You know what I'm doing is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and you never have chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is a little bit that fell in some place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, Ohio where I was the strange class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He made it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call of that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know us.
Could you go to Ohio and please bring to that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stand up with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, he had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany of the thing I told you about was made on itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was talking a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs to -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I would walk around with my water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> over another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall in the glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to <unk> and they hold on to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, to see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, in large as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> it melts as a <unk> I'm breathing his <unk>
As you melts as a iceberg, releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its path for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very unlikely to actually get to witness an <unk> boxes.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day at the same time, every <unk> a baby. OK.
So two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want it to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception itself, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my ground to get two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people will define the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered bodily fluids the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with American sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having an sex that didn't be held in the male and male forms of a female.
For example, it's the case of the individual with the <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that they are <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors from testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
This is <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops by a course typically <unk>
When you go to the baby the baby looks like a child.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast phones but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something going on.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and an chromosome and y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone hormone.
Most of the women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman -- it doesn't know her <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman most women as I'm sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have the <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing, not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 years born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, I was wearing a life as a boy and he had just found that I had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th of the 20th and the uterus and the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a hormone hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19 years when he started having criminal problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example from a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know well why that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of body is going to be <unk> twins, or <unk> twins or <unk> -- <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that it was <unk> several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- it will be a black <unk> it means to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic <unk> concept.
Imagine the amazing thing that it is to have children born as two people inside one body.
The highest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> got in the fabric of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to be able to figure out whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there's no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go over the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought they were <unk> categories that are going to be <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- they're much more <unk> than they were doing.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens to be much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we put in science in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in our current culture, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would put him a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved on, I still don't know it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organ from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma really death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought of <unk>
It was from the idea of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent one of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each other as seeing that music, <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
Parents were <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were doing, was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we were going to do, our Parents -- <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA -- but they had the idea of the right thing to be born.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the right of the blood right to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents -- <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it for a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences -- that was very radical.
And in part of it they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it remains very clear -- if you look at the story of the translator, <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were getting rid of the explanations -- <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of power being transmitted by a <unk> idea of the right thing to be born.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement <unk>
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women were born.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color that we engage with <unk> <unk> about the difference and again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking wonder why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years they should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense and I think we should be a <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they are going to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
So imagine that one of them, "Sorry, was three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born on June 1 from 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, Henry, in virtue of being considered man, or I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Or you don't have the same rights to marriage as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science came up so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of the anatomy that we have to admit to that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up to science, but at the same time I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line on some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught up in a weird position.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't do tests and they do not support people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this to give rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 to know.
So how do you put the subject of content on <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with <unk>
Do we want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian than a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to vote for a drug change in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that had done a <unk> twins and then pick them up and then pick up their fame.
But when he asked the phone, I asked the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political wire instead of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change for the good time.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "This is the stupidest question I've ever heard.
feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing <unk>
But the more I have thought about his question, most of me has kind of like that there is a female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers were really excited to find the way to protect the people in the state of the state, it might be that there are more likely to be given to this concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that is what we have to do in the future when you get the democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a <unk> <unk> let's think about what we do for others.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go to live and work, it has a chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than the building cost.
So we could easily put it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just took away by buildings.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in the apartments were already owners, and that half of the half is still not <unk>
They could try to increase the capacity by making progress in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around the surrounding people have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions in the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place to build a whole new apartment building totally new, and when the rules of that place will be able to build the construction instead of <unk>
So I proposed that governments -- new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk> <unk>
Did you know that every year around 75 <unk> they would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next election -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we use reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of trials with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, such as those rules that say you can't go to go and pick up all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes as much of technologies as the rules for <unk> and usually are the rules that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, an Guatemala friend sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a movie hall.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> terrain that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point when there was a pause, they said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> land -- which is a <unk> which is going to be held there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least <unk>
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained was that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city to the one that you could go could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North
And it also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the U.S. government would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries that would help them to establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all rely on the <unk> they actually become <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily <unk>
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to allow these special regions of development.
In a country I had just moved through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> are all <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, he passed over to another voting on the way to one.
Immediately after the voting on the 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> of about 30 percent <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new great center of the city that is building in Korea, is bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years, after four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the ultimate court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to move in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change another place.
There's a million a year that comes out from Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family back to get a work, and sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money to just eat their clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are no kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank TED TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and then more recently, to photograph and publish on my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second car stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> and my aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like <unk>
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel like I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I figured I'd be able to find everything else that I want to use after you get here to <unk>
And because I don't know me as the woman who walks up with TED clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
I call this tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost see a phenomenal look at 50 dollars.
All the whole together, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get rid of them as well.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe that you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal universal truth, six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very personal style of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people were approaching this week, just because of what I was using and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to let certain things.
I don't need to be obsessed with these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant people if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I think.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So, where would your brain look at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both of them -- at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
And I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists are <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite a intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then look at them as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A intuition that may have developed with the step of the years is the one that one thing can be only in a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid, and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar <unk> taught him a valuable lesson, and it's that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except that you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago; you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but it's not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't do it all of the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here's a big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard a springboard -- and that was <unk> in a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming hole that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an open elevator -- I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people can go up with doing those things, because I don't want them to do it, or I don't want to <unk> or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues in the voyage of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then they put up a <unk> and pulled out all the air -- and then they put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being only in the <unk> the little metal piece is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
And we discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it was to <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And when you give it a soft thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that metal piece are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> the <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal bit is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logic that is talking about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights up, and we looked into the box, we saw the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, seemingly all objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define you who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 and 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining to just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I didn't get married, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that actually doesn't matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with a single click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the trip.
Are you going to go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign there.
If the museum shows the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the pictures.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came up and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I was talking a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And it seems to be very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to get the image, so you actually see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to quickly jump back again to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and it really gets it up.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it as before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, and I created this function that I call "The <unk> -- we just put a zooming around it.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things out, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like looking at these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, it even also didn't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to their art work, and it's represented properly online.
And the great question that they do today is you said, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I've got something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> -- a pixel <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from origin, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture in the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened to be something very interesting in the <unk> <unk> one in the last two decades.
Some time ago, if you wanted to win a race of Formula 1, I took a budget and I would take it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, <unk> control control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're going back to the free air.
And as <unk> they're starting to answer differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities are big.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex -- but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
More than cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for weekends in MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms to become sensors and <unk>
And that's really changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo, <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end of it took the hammer and threw it down to the Moses -- you still see a small dent in <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and I said, <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> <unk> in the idea of putting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were played by Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity of the Web in the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
Time line is at the top.
And then early there are people around here, and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people make a quick call on the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then all the world's <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can actually measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and we consume it.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it gets <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were doing different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little bit of a little chip, a <unk> to the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> it doesn't fall in some place on the planet.
So if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day is still there.
What if we showed that people, then we will be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and a lot of other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is run on the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe has a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces, in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open up and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels and you can write on them, I'll show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to Mayor <unk>
It liked it very much.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows -- but when you come up with it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building, and all of the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when someone goes down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> what happens in it.
And here I am myself trying to do not <unk> the sensors that open up the water.
I think I should tell you what a night happens when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opened up to let me happen, but a building that followed <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physicists, the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, the one that changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can reach, and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. What we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with a entry that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet ballet scholars today, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can make all the movement.
You can walk around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our metabolic environment as an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of them just a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, of the power of the <unk> of the power to physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people get involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered on the ground.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from below, to share the main moments of the London Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they might improve <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be stronger than a <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of them.
How about living with good health?
Or maybe they're those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is it that they <unk>
What would you like if they could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to do creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> You probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference and I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, the one that interests us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been perhaps been about 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry in the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> gives you the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot, dark water, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you might want without effort in your side.
It really is like a quick pulse for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk>
But therefore we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two red cells.
But when <unk> organisms, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes in evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but with every year he was happening, every single time I was born.
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it, he finds a magnificent dancing dancing <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> of <unk>
He said, George, says, George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted them to be healthy.
I wanted to regain health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of the <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily contribute to longevity.
They didn't necessarily give the largest or stronger or faster and even more intelligent than even the smartest one.
Evolution led to the best creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, <unk> fish to <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead at the phase <unk> I would argue that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as species, we have <unk> our environment for us to be applied to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we get so much that it's not possible to have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the modern type of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is: the gears of the evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when a species <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, a bad and scary possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First consider that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to <unk> and familiar.
Just think that if it could be possible to be able to choose not only sex in their <unk> but in your own body making genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic change to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to 20,000 and a week.
It's not a lot of enough to make the human genome actually by <unk> and to be more and more and more of all of us all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect them but they are going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course with the flu flu vaccine, in a plant of tobacco plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two other <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life opportunity to eliminate diabetes, remove the <unk> reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an <unk> Ken <unk> especially if I was able to <unk> with the next generation of the machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to we would have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can get them to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these options in order for a better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose some different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For worse, or for worse, and before what I could do is these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds <unk>
Well, I had a single seat and I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So they immediately looked at them, and they said, "You know, there's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is <unk> the Hudson River.
Normally that's not the road.
It will take the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words have heard about.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
<unk> <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before I died, and I thought about all the people I want to do in life, and I thought all of the fences I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to do is all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I thought that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot of -- I thought, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I am sorry the time that we were talking about things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14 <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, he will not fear fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children to grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a little bit.
And to me, that was the whole reason for the world.
And at that point I understood that by connecting those two points, the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be -- but you can imagine, and how do you get?
What are you saying that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships change and the negative energy for them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the coolest thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> has a total <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation company, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that you could see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important person and you have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, and they go <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to the only wish to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was obsessed with his brother and her father in that very precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk to you about -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on your inside cannot be able to <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and record negative space.
So they go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of you start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization to move the things back to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that you could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from the whole corner of the whole corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the back of the back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something totally stupid and that when they were going to have taken off the walls of the walls and they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we got to go to the round of <unk> my son was part of my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sunlight that we buy on the shipping walk of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and Home <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a camera -- <unk> we put it into a light of LED and now there's a device that is free -- and there's a device that is free -- we published the <unk> code, the software is low in a <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture, because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of planning, Tony <unk> all night, Tony went to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran out the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time he was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and they would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to <unk> and do it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money on this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then in December, Time magazine recognized it as one of the best invention in 2010, and it was really great.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the center of Los Angeles -- is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there was in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology. I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you to do all of us every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, you will go, and if I'm not me, I am <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
Nineteen of <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days by eating this very much fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been involved in situations like the only goal to deal with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that make interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that you see it <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights to the name of my TEDTalk -- 2011.
What had been this: What was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be able to get it in the face, especially if I put it in ridicule you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would have had no <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the <unk> the <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to do it -- nothing could be so difficult to be so difficult to be as difficult as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that deals with <unk> and marketing and advertising, and all the film was <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, and it has images all the time -- it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea together, <unk> <unk> is what? <unk> <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the score of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure of <unk> all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe -- and it becomes the most cool shoe you have <unk>
The most cool car that you have led to "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink you have <unk> <unk> from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea all shot -- the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I'd love you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it is the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people there.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for them to do, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands to convince a couple of brands for them.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that film is going to look at us as a whole bunch of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the responses will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film to be me?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have nothing to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many as possible, to make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle is worth of attention to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you search for <unk> images on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that came up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President of the president, the <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it something that changes suddenly.
But why? Well, it's the transparency day --  like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
They had an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to be <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there's him looking at me as a single <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in history.
There's your story, and it's my story, and it's <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, it would have to take off the proxy and go to companies myself with my whole team.
So what I started to see is suddenly -- and I started to give me a little bit of time -- when you start talking with the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films -- huge giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies say that the reason their films have so much success is because of the brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, <unk> movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "You're good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would give one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: Are we a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more well a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people to be the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: variation.
MS: <unk> is not the way you want to describe something that you can do in <unk>
Man: We talked about something else?
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep them cool time? With better <unk> three times a <unk>
Things like those <unk> benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray colors, and things like that.
They usually carry it as sunglasses, or I like the <unk> and the same way.
Woman: If Dan was a mark it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part part of <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the type of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand of Tom, but I often <unk> me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they could do it for them, you surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? Because I think your world is the world that <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come and start in a place and in my case where they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next one is the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what do you do that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find right now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to have fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
And there was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> brand <unk> <unk>
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or on the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be able to avoid avoiding the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually get them <unk> and make something positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic <unk> Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: An <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to raise your identity of brand, your personality personality -- what would that be?
Are you a <unk> <unk> you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or audacious <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
Are you <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, secure, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
So we allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how now you use the fMRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much commercial marketing centers as well as for movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the open.
All over the city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the road in the schools in the U.S.
And the incredible thing for me is that the projects I've had the biggest answer or the ones that I've been more successful in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was sent to the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was launched in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press and TV or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk about is giving their customers not to be a part.
I've always believed that if you take a risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get people out of that being pushing it to failure.
I think when you train their employees in aversion to risk is preparing their entire company for <unk> for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to us is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we have to turn to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends in <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> huge data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: And so, <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on behalf of the TED matrix -- the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their highest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are in real time systems.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus of Windows in a laptop using an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> enters the orange box <unk> <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
Is it easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> -- using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to want to do something with these <unk> these <unk>
So that struck us attention, and we started an experiment where we went through our environment, and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very strange things.
They were <unk> as a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at active in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place: it's actually going to be working on that place: is actually going to be working on that place: it's going to be working on that place: is actually working on that place: it's going to be working on that
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
Could be, let's say for example, a <unk> power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled up the attack code, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed with very professionally professionally people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all of the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much they were <unk> the operator.
So you know it.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and the high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we were able to make sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were calls to function in the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and information structures and we tried to deal with the real world, with potential access to the real world.
We need theories about <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To get to the theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the plant of nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
So rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
So I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts of stages.
And guess what is in the code of <unk>
An almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
It wasn't just like this.
The results have been from it after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to start again.
Yet we found out that both digital <unk> were pointed to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and doing the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what's the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we looked at really <unk>
That's the gray, gray, and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the entry values of sensors for example of sensors and the vibration sensors and the vibration sensors, which is still running during the attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open escape valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can see bad things.
The plant can explode.
And neither of the <unk> and the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
Could it work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It will be more possible as possible.
And if you made that, with what we do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start to make it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main person behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take and give <unk> skills or other people who make users of the wheels and raise them to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that goes in in the morning, gives you a big strength, which is also going to increase its speed, and help you for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get a lot more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human
Soldier: With the <unk> <unk> I can save 90 pounds by land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it goes up my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair, which I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people who are roughly, on wheelchair, all over the world.
One percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens frequently, very young people, with damage to the backbone that when their lives -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that it's grown up quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury in the neocortical column and as a result couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors.
completely <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
Also there are some batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress with this very simple and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 in the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down it <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all sensation and all movement from <unk>
Soon after that, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you will never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole me the last little bit of hope for my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs <unk> and scale rocks and even ride on the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to affect the life of future generations -- not only from soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of lawn chairs to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> sex to say, hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the <unk> <unk> of the rainforests of Congo.
The Bonobos are along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives on the closest close ones.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've been too focused on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts in danger of <unk>
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation are making it not to fill up or a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we are not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we know how the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
By <unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a kid.
For us, and they are fundamental to establish links and <unk> <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors as many connections.
And when you look at the game, you see the roots, the same of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual in humans.
The game is the glue that we connect us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> baseball game, and I don't talk about football game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case to him, I love, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because this is this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements of the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, as it does, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these skills.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But do we get to the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate thing to play, you can be the moments in which it is the most urgent time.
So my fellow primates, we will embrace this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of a captain in a volunteer body.
And in our city, where volunteers are invited to a highly skilled personnel you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But still there was a race to the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our homework was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  He got first to the captain and he asked him to walk into and would save the dog owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a <unk> building to save a live living because I was a <unk>
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go to the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a couple shoes from shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the fire fire -- that height had finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house with the owner of home where, as he was waiting, his trove got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at on the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary fireman -- I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of grace of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room in this room to people that have achieved, or are there to be -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you, <unk> now.
They put food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood park.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a cement measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the largest construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> brick came to all the home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 miles per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the block of particular, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks -- stacked to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows you to create much higher circuits and more complex circuits a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was only to experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they bring together together.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the side, the pink is the stream, the rose and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue and a very quickly, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with the green produce light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, it's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program it, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or more slow, you just turn this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to be <unk> to <unk> ready to use.
<unk> solar panels, <unk> <unk> everything needs to be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night light, or why the door of an elevator <unk> it goes open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --  a few weeks ago, we took the designers in the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "Let's do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done a <unk> cannon in a movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became a other material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So, <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for the environment in focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I've got the time <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like about <unk> <unk> to <unk>
We have a few members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of getting them to Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
His task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I look at a quote, but what really looks for is that someone is caught up by the snow, because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this way <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment <unk> a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else else that <unk> citizens with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do it, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has one component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it makes something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads in a viral form.
One responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this application realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> but people are <unk>
And so he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens of <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks out when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are <unk> using it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little government technology will know that this doesn't happen yet.
<unk> acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that I had done by the normal channels would have taken at least two and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the court of California that even over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an application that shows in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of a warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not like in private schools, as many people think it should be.
Neither as a technological enterprise, but also more like the Internet.
That is to say, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to tackle the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good at the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country who contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given the government.
Do you feel a big frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we lost in sight.
And that is that if you leave the feelings of politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that are given us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they are not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics doesn't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of phone care center, and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started using animal control.
And then he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of home, put it hard music and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So please Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a <unk> center.
It has a mobile, web and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
We don't know that app.
It was the work of very intelligent people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened to get this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good evening. <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean by the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will join and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected to two people.
And it could have been connected with government services that we need to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think you're the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is a vote.
How many times have chosen to be a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will monitor our values and we will bring our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's why we call it <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what it holds for us that we financed as something that was happening in our against that thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy to be sexy.
Because it's where the real government work happens.
We have to collaborate with the government engine.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism is <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do with government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government as it can be able to expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and know that it's not that hard to act -- you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a larger generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express your views at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem doesn't matter so much to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set out the work to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> <unk> a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
And of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons. jails and the death row.
I've spent the most part of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing about these stimulus -- has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things you say here have impact all the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about the <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way it looked like the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug for them.
I got so strong that I could barely breathe out and then I was shocked.
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> I was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he told him that no, I was <unk> again, and if he said yes, I was allowed to kill me.
I had this human quality that made you always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
When I first thought it was a game.
And then I looked at him and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she stood up and went around the room, and he said, "Come on the room, and he said, "Come on, <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just I want you to <unk> three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to tell them that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing -- although the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then he finally said, "Well, the third thing I want you to tell me is that you never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural South rural -- I have a brother a year and a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> gave us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just get <unk> of always, right?
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you always do the same thing as we are.
And I took something, your sister as well. <unk> a <unk>
I said, "No. I don't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I put it up with the <unk> and you say, "Oh, you're not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells us all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying that it's a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really doesn't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think they could do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, it is so much <unk> and despair, by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or <unk>
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, of 50 to 60 percent of all the people in color are in prison or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
Are we <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in some of the things that are very curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you care about rights for always if you have an informed <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population is definitely the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was before it was before it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where he was given to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without any chance of getting out.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were teaching people in the death row.
This issue of death death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, whether we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty is defined by mistake.
Out of nine people who have identified one that is innocent and <unk> that is <unk> and liberated from the death.
A rate of error, <unk> an innocent from every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation you wouldn't have ever allowed to fly airplanes if from every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I'm talking about terror, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
Really, we don't know a lot of this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come close to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you conduct science <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism.
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamics that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
And all of the time we get to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
<unk> will never be able to have it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we could never be able to get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> were going to be <unk>
And I think about this.
How do we feel like that in a world where a nation like Germany, would teach people, especially if they were in their own <unk>
We could not get it?
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology. It will affect creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, it needs to integrate both things.
lately we're talking about the need to have more hope, more <unk> more <unk> with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
If you think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are. It was so rational, so rational, so rational, as rational as the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, the development comes not only about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas from <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection to your mind is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to truly be human beings if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mr. <unk> lady called me to say, <unk> comes <unk>
Do you want to come and do it.
I said, "I know I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was sitting there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We're trying to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We're trying to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and then he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, these issues, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lying, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't <unk> it isn't that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's how it is.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that although it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, because of our design and our rational capacity or rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but because of the way they treat the poor, they <unk> their prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I get too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my customers from 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it isn't it?
The judge is the <unk> as an adult, but I see a boy.
A very late night I was awake -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask something of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> client a little poor, black black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> <unk> <unk> to be treated as a privileged white white <unk> executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical and a lack of ethics.
Next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or a really <unk>
For my horror, I didn't only have it <unk> but he had sent the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went on to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car walking to court.
I was going up the stairs when I came up with a black man named <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
So I came up to me and I was shocked.
And I got rid of the ear, I was <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I got to the <unk>
When they walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I said. And we started going on.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They came up the cops with the prosecutors all the <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how, the room was full of people, and we're talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about <unk> because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, I turned to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I just looked out the window, and we would hear all that <unk>
I was walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with a concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
<unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black guy stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, "You know, to this guy from audiences to tell this young girl who keeps his view in the target <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we cannot truly be human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's a lot of opportunities on close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be a <unk> effort that are spent today in punishment today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, over the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases is not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come up to the rule of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge drop in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the <unk> rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war on drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into a chain that will be able to steal a bicycle, a little <unk> for small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our philosophy today about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats for Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be about the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop to all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So for a <unk> of stories that was <unk> to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood -- <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices provide us negative news, seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what it really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the amount of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we just just with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average income per capita income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy was about 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people will get it.
And we follow <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, great part of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, no water, toilets, TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
We have a lot of this technology and the technology -- this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you put in technology technology jumps in this curve, Moore's Law, and it's doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft smooth -- in good and bad time in war and peace, in the recession in depression and <unk>
It's the result of computer computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and the ability to democratize the robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize personalized production around the planet, synthetic biology, fuel vaccines and food, the digital medicine and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" on Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I sought the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, and it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the World to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
He's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made of aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet called by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about default, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy took 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the United States, the solar <unk> will cost six cents a hour compared to the time compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
They took a famous picture. How did you get <unk>
"A pale <unk> point.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and <unk> by the <unk> of water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology that's available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of water to the day of any <unk> <unk> water water <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that I will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which so that it would be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation that has this technology today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent cell penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has a better mobile communication in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And, of course, with a smart cell with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communication that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video libraries of books and music libraries of books and music, the diagnostic technology is now <unk> and they lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to when you get the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is a <unk> X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to address these technologies in a mobile device that you talk about, and because it has <unk> they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world where there are no doctors, where <unk> burden is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that will not be able to call the health care and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just passed the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion people on the Internet.
Three billion minds never before we had to get to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you do? What <unk> wishes.
And instead of an economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of the story.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of Academy and because of using impressions in 3D and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than never before.
What can we provide 3,000 million more of the members of human humanity, and educated and <unk>
What about some voices never had before <unk>
So what if we give them the prisoners, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and being able to act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 billion?
And if you are the contributions we can't afford it.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small equipment, guided by their passion with an objective of course, can do things that they could only do the great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that probably some heard of know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way that protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with college professors in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went around and they started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovative passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to get us to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, like you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually have fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures are still saying they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates the other concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned so much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, some <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 feet -- the <unk> black card.
And the fishery of this <unk> was very plentiful and spent for a good moment, so he made more than half in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the amount of fish had fallen in half.
I went to the five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this kind of ugly, very ugly, <unk> <unk>
I went out in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea of China <unk> and, especially in the <unk> Sea.
What we had captured it was <unk>
<unk> now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains that are fish coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing set.
The bottom is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to do that, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what we collect the fishermen every time they are going to an area where they've never fish.
But it was no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
They took the start to start the start to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, a lot of <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will be able to use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the idea of changes.
And at the end of keeping a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they left.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before we <unk> it is a little bit.
You don't lose animals.
You lose extremely common.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
Over time you have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, isn't the way they expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like I was a captain such as a captain as a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually they don't use the scientists of fishing -- because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From the big role that it can be a protected area.
Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle west, for example?
I think that there is the arts and cinema -- maybe they can fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay
A long time ago there were gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the film <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron -- to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today, we will see why the videos are made viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk>  <unk> <unk> When I was younger, it seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They get over 48 hours to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of those, gets a number of visits to <unk> and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of participation communities and a surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of the bottom last summer.
<unk> was not intended to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the <unk>
The creators like Jimmy <unk> present us with new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   You all want to get on a Friday.   Everybody wants to get the weekend --    <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it's Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday Friday Friday day.
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or an creators group will embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's like that, that's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's rare, you know there's a <unk> version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone made an old version of it.
And then they did international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a silly joke to something that we all can be <unk>
Because today it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Black RS: <unk> <unk>
What could I script might have written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up with a minute, just that really unexpected and unexpected can <unk> the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that <unk> against <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I want to be <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that make you circular adapted through the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to have five million people seen and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all about how new we do <unk>
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend and creative communities of participation, which is totally unexpected, are features of a new culture of a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity of.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrity of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- they're just the current media features -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose whole life had been supported by the only unit of unity and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so long, friends, now <unk>
They are <unk> in silence.
He died a broken story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was trying to get it out, but I got it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and an <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task -- the escape of their family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat goes down to the sea dressed in the hot <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the papers, rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we got older, we would first take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I did, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women throughout three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants in it.
Unlike the suburbs of middle class, whose existence was going to be in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> English fragments of the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a line of cars, working six days, double turn.
Yet I found time to study English and get a title at IT <unk> from the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what they should have been <unk> which was usually <unk> <unk>
Two pairs in school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until your nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry transition and <unk> and <unk> children trapped between two worlds.
They looked subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the <unk> classical student, relentless with what I was talking about myself.
On the other day, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of physicians, I picked up the youth Australian the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't <unk>
In fact, <unk> <unk> resident in <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about nothing.
I wanted to retreat to the labs and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when she got up the ship.
There was never been a choice.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you <unk>
So I spoke about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking, the more was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger -- a newly new arrived at the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that you're going to be grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, a optimism <unk> a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I would take you to a little group of people who have the slogan not <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> it to night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some of the brilliant, we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
And after a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and bring the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and ensure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came up and said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us together, we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would be very easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of how easy the right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave in every wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give you and see them in a certain way, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing changed from the age of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to <unk> a car and <unk> the sky.
We now make it with airplanes.
And in that time when we <unk> the great prince warrior Indian, I had <unk> he had a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery was replaced to the magic.
And that gave me a great deal.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed that technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to do not <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> is for the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, from hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and the cameras get the cameras to be <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I <unk> me back to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect readers in the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
They put up the text with the image, and it animation and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And this --  --  says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner child are excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me out.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad, to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag towards this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy I've always had maps but have been the static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that tries to present today as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> they were attached to their <unk> they have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where we have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
And I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't already do it.
So to restore this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, we have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of the magic, the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on, and it's actually augmented and by augmented reality you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
So at a moment, the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
So we're going to a world where the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology come up one another.
It will take the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> <unk> projects.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems because of all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and it turns out.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple that every time I get <unk> sends my information back to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my body problem is not at the same time as I need assistance to <unk> or any urgency of that style -- but I just see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move to the people of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available here.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to take care of their homes, taking their blood pressure to their doctor, and share it with each other, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, turn back the control of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video video.
We all have sailing navigation to <unk>
Maybe we have even in our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk> are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
And we created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes it open up in a <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks of Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we want to do it at the global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> across the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else -- can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You could be messaging services or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please take care of this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion with my drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera -- the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that the process ends when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when we press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a unexpected.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time but with the common aim of keeping the <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
You know, we will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capturing an idea that has to capture a moment.
But what's the trick that makes them look real?
They're the details or the <unk>
Would you make light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here's three things that are perfectly <unk> something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if I was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain out, because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about these different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to look like realistic I think they're those in which we don't even know the things that are around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important, because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> have the same kind of light.
And these two images get to these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And in the personal I think it's easier to create a place that you'll find it because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone of stone.
And yes, I even made a red house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to achieve realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures the result it can be very beautiful and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start with a slide of technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one that took out of a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details of the detail but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line in scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk>
Here's something strange.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights up.
<unk> more intensity because they write on paper.
Why do technology <unk> <unk> in <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where you say, this is the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you had some other technology, some other technology, like transport, at a <unk> curve would be very dumb -- we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it happens to be a <unk> change.
If the transportation technology is as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development in a <unk> growth that every few years genetically orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It would take one of two things.
Or you either turn into a typical curve. I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and to ask myself, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
How new state is going to the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a few two thousand years ago when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals going around it.
If we look at the way that chemicals are organized we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and is, at that moment, there was a little bit of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes in their inside.
Some of those oil droplet was held a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate out of the outside of the outside and the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops aren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemists.
And every time they <unk> it was a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So each <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that in a way <unk> being better at the time of bringing up chemical chemicals -- more chemicals -- more chemicals and <unk> more.
Most of them lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, and it was a very simple chemistry, but things get really interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to register what were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable remained stable since it evolved a half thousand years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people from the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would take you 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years.
But then we came up with another big step on the one that things became very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicating information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be able to form communities that in a way, they were together in it, and set up a <unk>
In that way, <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities became approached by so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe in the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve the heart, or the muscles of the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to eat a certain piece of fruit, because I knew it was sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism since before they had built these information processing structures that were able to have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruits for hundreds of thousands of years.
And so the fact that the nervous system built those information structures really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea -- vague and <unk> in your head that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turned it into sound, in sound, and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now pass through periods of similar periods to <unk> organisms, and our <unk> presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> the computer <unk> the <unk> tape, and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to drive that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in common.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've got the time scales again.
The first stages of history that told them to take a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the following, like electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess that's the right word to name something that does its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me, <unk> in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that they didn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using again is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from <unk> <unk>
Could you run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to point out numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk> numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so that none of them made it.
But once luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that you best did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we would get the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analogous to <unk>
Let's take two programs that are <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and the children would take the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
And we had some mutations in it.
And it tries to try and do it again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are <unk> absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to look at them to see how they work.
They are extremely <unk>
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the goal that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering occur.
We don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so I can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
Are we <unk>
And we're at a time analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is that it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I came up.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've got enough time enough to let me give some of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go out and <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300, about 300 percent of a <unk> that I said, 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who is trying to <unk> the first base -- not to go to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Big <unk>
Well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, this is somebody who comes out of 10 <unk>
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League of the League of <unk> to run more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I think about this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
That's how it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a wanted -- has two arteries -- <unk> and his family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 of those.
But you know something?
She's getting a pretty better improving this year.
And their hits and their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask:
What do you think must be the average of a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do is, however, is sending them into the world, and I included, with the bottom of being perfect.
That would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> for a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my type of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic is frequent <unk> and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as long as we get more and more knowledge.
And I was going very well. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you get everything, then it would know everything, or as possible, close to all, because I would get rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At that moment, I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when the emergency room requested a cardiologist was going to go to that patient.
And I would report to the chief <unk>
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which would tell me a heart failure.
In these conditions your heart stops working, and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are all filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was <unk>
He gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
And I gave it <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very good.
And there was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home to her house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did not do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident working with constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even talking to my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it to her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so confident that I asked the nurse who <unk> Mrs. <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to total <unk> "Yes, I think it's right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the tall, and the ambulance along with the ambulance who took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I would take off to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do normally, I did.
It went through the emergency room back to home.
And there was another nurse, not that I was talking about Mrs. <unk> before, but another one told me three words -- those three words that most emergency medical emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
"He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to her house, after I was at the high school, he suffered a collapse, and her family called the <unk> the ambulance was brought to emergency room with a blood pressure from 50 millimeters to <unk> which means a severe shock of it.
I would just breathe and it was blue.
<unk> personnel for the inner staff of their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and hoping against all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days the next few days it was obvious that I never will.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And in ninth day, he was left to go. " wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the next weeks I was obsessed with that, and I experienced for the first time the <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I was like, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure that I would take the things and I made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little at a little bit of this feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in one day I was opened the sky and finally came out the sun and asked me if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to ask the efforts to be perfect for not making any more errors, I would file those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked up because I was a little bit <unk>
It was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran the door to the door, he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to my <unk> change asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and he didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a terrible condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it's going on top of it, and it can be causing the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, she didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics by going on it, and they recovered the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And this is a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to go to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
We had an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out a colleague of mine who was checking the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
He made a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk>
I checked it and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon <unk>
They both were operated and recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was shocked.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get my breath out and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, believe that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that do not sleep, and the ones that have <unk> results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you stop from medicine to people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical care and errors to learn how possible, from the first paper I wrote for the first article that I wrote for the Toronto, Star Trek to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where errors happen every day in which one of every 10 drugs are born in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly and more <unk> and causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die in this country, they die by <unk> medical <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is spreading every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes and <unk> and all of a sudden my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get <unk> and we eliminate all of the professionals rather than to error, well, not anybody.
And so that people don't want to talk about their <unk> cases.
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell you all from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students are <unk> <unk> and <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They could say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor is human, it's human, they accept it, and it doesn't be proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They would take their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they become some mistakes of time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot, but I will try to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose an average American is about 70 to a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks of these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many you belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How do you plot the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
So while I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to meet their answers.
When I do a question, as I am blind, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
So in another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I loved one occasion, why I never bought nothing?
This is a shelf on <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> that came from trees.
And I decided I went to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> well this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
It was a set for <unk> right to the store.
We put there on six <unk> or 24 flavors and look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent that when there was only six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
When I was stopped when there was only three percent he got to buy <unk>
When you stood up when he had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we will probably get less likely to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices will affect us in a good <unk>
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from a country of the country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money <unk> available in savings plans to retirement the <unk> program, <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 different choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about the <unk> the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those of you who decided to participate, the more the number of choice, more people will be <unk> by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
As soon as I had more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to the offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we are going to make the decision, that <unk> even though this is against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and in health.
They are more likely to pick up things that are less likely to choose -- even though you see them better.
The main reason is that we were looking at at looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today I want to <unk> four simple techniques that we have <unk> in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is that if you decide to be able to be able to be able to be able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> options, there will be a <unk> increase in sales, it will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> and 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I eliminated the products for the <unk> of cats that are less <unk> became the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and low costs.
You know that the supermarket.
In a Wal-Mart store, there are about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to handle the choices is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the employees of Harvard are <unk> automatically to a life of life.
Those people really want to choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do it to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience with a whole holiday audience, with all paid the world's most beautiful road.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
Okay. Okay. All right, whatever is ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really did hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first turn, than in the second turn, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the <unk> of choice that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were being used to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting that I was looking at exactly how we had a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give the staff to you who would think of the positive things that they would spend in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> 20 percent increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a lecture aisle of magazines.
We saw that in <unk> supermarkets along the <unk> <unk> show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating indicates me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> OK. Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This classification is totally useless.
The categories need to indicate something that they were going to do, not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk>
Well, who are they <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think -- if I only did it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision that you buy a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows <unk> completely.
You have to make 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each one.
I have 56 color outside of the car.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choice, four <unk> to 56 colors, so many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How far you are.
If you were <unk> always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again.
<unk>
If you go from a few options in many, they continue there.
The same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information is presented to us.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of changes don't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We were excited about a product that we're building that we now have more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to be used in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to the best of a choice is to be careful by <unk>
And the more they are more careful in our choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s in the East Germany -- if you had a typewriter I had to write to the government.
You had to register a blade of text written with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would be the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print on a page, that page will end up having a few bright yellow dots on each page that are still a pattern that makes them just one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to do a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems on the Web.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
They're <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online cases that we had money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a computer <unk>
The secret secret of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> Is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely that any of us are a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from bad to worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, motivate them to motivate them to find them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the national America, governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority from the Netherlands -- or, actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and create a <unk>
Last week, I said, in a meeting with British government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do they have <unk>
Well, you need you to have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign political authority authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police headquarters and during the <unk> of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a big scale of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the U.S. government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to the governments that do this to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected of a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen online to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious response should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect it because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's a game of privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we will live today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi doesn't have fences in the highest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying they protect our community and cattle, and they are also painful with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community, at six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing to happen to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because it even helped male lions see the <unk>
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions to they believed that I was close to <unk>
But lions are really smart --  they came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So she jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that is moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken tower.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- the electricity to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to say that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never came to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- they were killed and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> you can see in the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to <unk> other predators as receiving <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants of farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes and tell me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in a plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electric inventions in it.
What's the next to your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electrical <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know you have invented electric devices, but I want to do mine.
CA: So I read it for a time -- right and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: The foot of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to get it in every step that I would get my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will come back all the time studying Kim <unk> history, but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought it would be all my life in North Korea, until it all changed a sudden changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When we do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two previous weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
One woman without life was dead on the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine fell to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and the tree.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark in the night except for the lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes, I looked at bodies floating on the river,
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> farmers.
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as life as a refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I stood up at the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told each other, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, everybody can be able to get it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to turn to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I was hoping for.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
And also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even I went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea it was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for college exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be moved to the force to a separate location in the <unk>
They had to run away from immediately.
So I started planning how to help it escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked me to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer approached my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I made all of us to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at high distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came up with the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary -- I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family, and for two North Koreans and to get them from prison.
I took my whole heart, and I asked him, "Why would I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I said.
"I'm helping the people <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown unknown is a new hope for me and for the people to <unk> when I was more <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays that the <unk> people need it.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education practices in the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in touch with family family still in the inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Center.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for the South Center to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles and South Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of <unk> food, fast <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a <unk> <unk> Los Angeles and Los Angeles -- home to the food places to carry and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to get kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles and Los Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> that's like 15 miles away.
I was glad to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of house you see the effects of <unk> that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have any <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what come to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to keep it up.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our water forest -- trees -- you know, nine vegetables come.
What we do, we are a kind of a group paid by moving ahead of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city is on top of me and just <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that he had to remove my garden, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I said, "Come on in it?
An order of <unk> to plant food on a piece of land than nobody else would be.  So I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> terrain.
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million plants.
Why the hell does it not look like this?
We took a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
You know, your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there. I grew up my children there.
I'm going to become part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I developed my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> soils <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get rid of seeing what the earth can do if they let their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool for education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We're the land.
It will be <unk> to see how they affect guys.
<unk> is the <unk> act of <unk> and provocative that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and his daughter, and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my yard, and you see very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt like you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't recognize your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
So it's on the street.
That's what this is about.
I want you to do that, but at the time, I want you to get your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how it changed, so it changed so only for a moment.
And so Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in plan volunteer.
If kids are growing up, they will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if nothing of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind to what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which I'm stuck in -- I see these color guys that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block from gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The beautiful thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
So what I talk about is to put people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets in farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take your <unk>
That is her weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not called me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if they go on the bike, and these cars are now not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads out of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pore and water can go through it, so all of the water rainwater flows down the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water anymore.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all of the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones on the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of it.
First of a stone, then and then more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> well, I'm not going to harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage is in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so you only have a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they'll be <unk> and they will be separate from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the <unk> of steel in small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of <unk> steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big <unk> <unk> here.
<unk> oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tried many samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know of practice.
We take many samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of charge on them, and then we put it up with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even to double the life of the surface -- they actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts on it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening News on his little gray radius.
I had a big smile on his face that was unusual at the time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban fell out of Afghanistan and they made the girls illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could get them out.
Every day, we would take a different route so that nobody could be suspect of where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in football bags so that it seems to be shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it was extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives -- the students and our parents.
Back in a while, the school suddenly was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for your time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, my mother, out to the school, and so his father would <unk>
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our home to school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk not to educate their children.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated for our life and he was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want not to <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who takes him in the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why I <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite them, even though they were in front of a <unk> opposition in front of it.
Like <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to the village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to her home, you get the phone, a voice <unk> that if I kept sending his daughter to school, they would return to try.
<unk> now, if he said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been given to realize about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, often these are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> girls who went to school has been to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They were going to have these changes not very much, after retreat from the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, I see the <unk> and I see the <unk> future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day girls from <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with a lot of other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the middle of the <unk> the each of the regime, they bring billboards from freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a <unk> bravery in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to west, until the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and harvest the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with many other women, rebuilding civil civil society -- <unk> a continual and fair transition to democracy and <unk>
There were roughly 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> for <unk> a movement of women, leaders leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right of participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> which is <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was applied and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the elation of the elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the <unk>
Another day woke up with the news of the murder of government officers in the army.
And every day, every day woke up with the government of the <unk> and the <unk> of the human rights of the prisoners and their lack of law.
Our society, made up a <unk> mindset becomes more <unk> and it's removed from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all of us today to deal with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, we chose to be the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> so much men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what we needed the choices -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> representation of the most more than the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call a days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also putting the mercy in the place of <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, <unk> instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, desperately needs to be able to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions and the word <unk> has the same root in Arabic than the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans the whole humanity that men and women, of the people that all the tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all of existence.
So he said, "My mercy takes all the stuff."
So he said, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
They are going to make all the fun of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which has a equally primitive answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody gets <unk> Why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
I was 22 years old, I had had <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I creates my soul <unk> <unk> to the head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a silent <unk> <unk> where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in Harvard University, and I have a MBA in <unk> from Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working on the <unk> list of <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I'm nearly 20 years old, married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, every race, all of the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or said in another way, in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who was going to be held with a man who does it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age killed every year for couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or your patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had just finished <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and that worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed a kid in the field.
He had a few big <unk> like apples, and an <unk> <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that were done from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started to go out and loved all of me, which was ready, that he had gone to Harvard, I would put a passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I quit my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> that was entering the head in a physical trap. financial and psychological psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to be able to feel so safe he bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma to live smaller.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted me my hand, my life was really serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend suit from my mother and married him.
In spite of what happened, I was confident that we were going to live happy forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had been very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would be hurt.
I spent twice as much more in our moon of honey.
And the first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey, he got down to the traffic and threw a Big Mac Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or online at some point of their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a very good company.
So go back to my question: Why would I tell me?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a very strong man, and it was the only person in the world who could help us to face their <unk>
The other question everyone is doing is: Why do you just don't know.
Why didn't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we are the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence cases occur after the victim has gone to the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources -- the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are compelled for judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still follow asking why it doesn't just go down.
I was able to go back to it because of one last <unk> I was up to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody to the world: to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, to full unknowns, and I'm here today because all of you will be <unk>
We have the trend to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people who are a way to say "The fault is yours by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened and that they will take their lives joyful lives and happily like <unk> wives and moms completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I became marrying a <unk> man, and we have those three children.
I have that <unk> black <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, is it's a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head of someone who says that I will.
At this moment, they are just thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what silly thing to do, but this whole time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you, there's a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting your daughter, to her sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end up my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> just thrives in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis of insurance and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be accurate for 10 years ago.
And I feel like at this moment there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dress like this.   I'm lucky, I brought them clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were getting together, they don't have to do it now, but we'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Everyone has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> they're less <unk> I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and photographer would tell me that I would get my back back and I would get the back of the little hair in the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model now.
Because I'm a beautiful and white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do it, but <unk>
The first question is, how does it get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically wired to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> I've been known to leverage to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown -- and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on, and there are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told all and one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, were not <unk>
The next question that people are always doing to me is: Could it be a model when it's greater <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take it from that.
But after that, what I would really tell you to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list still <unk> No, no, Einstein -- I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> head of American <unk> or the executive executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be a model that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a resume and a bunch of jobs on your back, no matter what I mean, you want to be president of the United States, but you want to be president of the United States, but your partner <unk> <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I had a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
This is what I looked next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are teamed up with a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing to me is: do it for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to wear money, and they gave me for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> got a light light on red and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for power to <unk>
<unk> from these privileges because I looked not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way without matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino young women in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
When I looked for this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a model?
And I think the answer that they hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and it's also amazing to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And all that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever get asked, with a little bit of little legs and the brightest hair will be happier.
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the nearest clothes, but probably the women physically <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender and gender when I'm one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope that you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was better enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I didn't go to the <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum care in lighting it.
In fact, most of them took tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He just happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes in now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my daughter told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York City on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists who were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, nobody has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop the time in a week of October and to get us thinking about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, even though we always put the same photo, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how they perceive and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
And so recently in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store that <unk> small in the previous <unk>
And I described what it had felt about five years of foot in that same place.
And they assumed that it remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look in in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always going to get the picture.
Today I want to encourage you to all of you in the picture, and I didn't want to go close to someone and asked him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> <unk>
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, <unk> as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press that was <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament do not clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of diseases.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World who found primarily on the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the New World <unk> where we have 16 species -- these 16 11 are facing a high risk of extinction.
So why are they <unk> they're important, they provide vital ecological services.
They are our natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria help to absorb the anthrax that is not going to be for them to spread and caused great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with the old culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between UN and below Egypt.
In the mythology of the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil?
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> list, which means that at less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey to the livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a difference.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs have a huge amount of time for <unk> the number of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk> <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? OK, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they're going.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a housing problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? Can you become assets, make noise. They can write a letter to your government and tell you what we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When leaving this room, I would tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do -- and everything I do is I <unk> my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> young -- but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Coast, <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
In place of that, everything that we would do, the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where about Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with seeds and <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach the local and to farm tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, and what they would love to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  And we were terrified of the local people, in such fertile fertile -- they had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't hear anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here --  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a <unk> parachute to this size.
And we couldn't believe -- we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared on the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
I thought we just thought about the Italians to make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, what they were doing, what they were doing, what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that we would love to <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It's a part of an African woman, the harm that we've done.
Westerners -- we are <unk> missionaries -- a <unk> missionaries and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
Yet, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a culture different as if they were my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a culture different as if I was my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just respond to people, and I invented a system called the <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people, who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Do you get?
You would never have a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has to be for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has to have its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can have success alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not -- for once, but not in meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never be told in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So, planning has this point blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't reach their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work on face, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the medical doctor of the company, the medical doctor in business -- who sets up with you in your house, on the table, and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> garbage that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see to ask: "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And I was <unk>   So the government says, <unk> again, <unk>  We have done in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the <unk> business <unk> in history, passed away in a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
The planning is the kiss of death of the death of business.
So now we <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you -- privacy, you have to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and <unk>
What do you show you guys more about this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossils will not renewable <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There's not the technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> there was this group of people together, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York City to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in bullshit.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that supports New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared in the United States <unk> generic manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few times, <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. This is Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they're not going to talk to you.
Then you have to give you a absolute <unk> dedicated <unk>
And then then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell with a great financial <unk>
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be able to do, selling and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 companies of the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by a single person.
I would never hear the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small businesses in bars with their dedicated <unk> in bars and their dedicated people who are going to do for you, what someone made by this gentleman talking about this <unk> someone who speaks to you, what would you get?
What can you? Can you do it?
OK, you can get it. You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a <unk> point?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do you share more of our hopes for cows so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wild giants that give shadow <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always goes back to the music --  -- there's a show in New York City <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful things in the world, but also one of the most beautiful world's <unk>
I live close to this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was suddenly sudden and unexpected it.
I thought about death and so much.
And this gave me a profound gratitude for the lived and lived time.
It gave him clarity to the significant life of my life today.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to stop catching the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> Before they die of <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit in the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to give you one more."
Before I die I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> -- it's about giving rise to the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is most important to us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit, and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces, if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is a brief and fragile.
And death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that we get more power.
They think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces, can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more means to share, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's <unk>
You don't talk about it, but it brings better joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen to happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: has never been <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to talk about our childhood, trying to tell you the words that I couldn't even remember -- the little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, they would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the core of society, they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- which was <unk> and autistic <unk>
Now, for those fewer familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that will be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that gets faster in the world, there is no cause or no cure for it.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it was more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without biases, a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been a few difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> is going through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take you a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that are <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift in your interior, and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the shift dies in the moment where we are trying to be like others.
Please.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a computer teacher who gave a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  And I was scared.  <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and the big <unk> words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when she fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just as I felt like I had those conversations with the students, I really surprised me, the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the health care environment and health care -- and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and that engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones, because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said Einstein, it's just as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways of warm and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk>
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported by the area of the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple, <unk> phrase that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that will lead to our other senses and make a deeper sense of understanding of what they would get.
And I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English Mary is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that the defined defined much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you who search for a public charge no matter <unk> or beginning, and that, when he won, it gets the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, a leader.
They didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And they didn't even know that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed test.
And there might be <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
They read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call him if he did not call him or her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was actually a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a serious title with a ridiculous title like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama was lucky enough to keep there, hoping that the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to warn you, is that the University of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads at disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So the end won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I would like to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes that change a lot more the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under an illegal mine in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the darkness, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that they talk about, but mostly that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and <unk> with primitive.
Like everyone else, I carry a cheap flashlight of light that supports her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of the branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
And my hand came out, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days earlier, who lost control and fell <unk> feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep way of that hole at their lives without paying a reward and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never will, because they are <unk>
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the <unk> Summit of <unk>
Among all of the amazing people I met there I met in a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and actually, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was there in the world, but not such a degree.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very curious about ignoring this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> my stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
some, even I thought I considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of the slave slave all.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer at about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> of <unk> today.
And yet, today, you can be enslaving entire families for generations of <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over <unk> 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
A lot of have been <unk> with false promise of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without paid under a threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves are value, but those are disposable <unk>
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature at 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, in fact, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and bricks in their heads, and they take them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task and over again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> I was going to just pee out pretty <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera got too warm on the way and she stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, like, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
On the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> not <unk> Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not citizenship that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were already about.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his release and trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> stones for miles on <unk> terrain until they were waiting at the bottom.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children who had charge and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When we hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this world consciousness advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was passionate about women who had been previously sexually <unk>
They led me through the stairs <unk> that gave this fancy basement <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for prostitution by <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- are forced to <unk> clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer from sexual abuse to their customers.
From standing in <unk> I remember there is a sense of unintended <unk> and in that instant, I barely could imagine what it must be to be caught in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs all the way they were going.
There was no <unk> doors.
There were no window enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are being sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family family.
The hands of black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their kids.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
And I saw what it seemed to be a fishermen in a ship in a boat, two older <unk> some more young <unk> some more young children, a sense of it.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families and they were forced to work on a long way to work on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, <unk> to the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love, it's not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to the youngest slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were <unk> the last year, but they had been working from the last one.
At the cold night and <unk>
And it would be point that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the <unk>
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their motorbikes and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to take it through a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out very quickly.
Then he pointed out the path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with workers.
Many women had children tied up to their back and as they were looking for gold gold, they were looking for gold <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These mining are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet away, and these people carry heavy bags of stone that then will be shipped to another area where the stone can extract the gold.
The site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the ground, the margin is going to work at the other <unk> and also to be a little bit of children.
They are all victims of injuries, and the violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet to that, it's forced to work at night and day in that mine.
Even so, he was able to be liberated and educated with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that your images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to make the testimony of them and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves from each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're about people, real people, like you and me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I think I will not think of these so many beautiful people who have had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images will wake up a force in people like you, in people like you, and I hope that that force turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math physics, and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are kind of like management markets.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were telling us the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the story is demand for a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a virtuous ballet ballet mathematician.
In the last few years has become a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness of <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the movement are not biological <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if the patients could do the test these ourselves?
It would have no personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is <unk> as well as the conventional <unk> you see, in some sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows somebody while it emits sounds to the talk, and we can imagine as a dancers of a vocal election, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs, to produce sounds and we all have the genes that we need to do -- the <unk> for example.
And, like <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a kid learning to speak.
And from the sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as it does, and as well as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
And in the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of <unk> strings.
We see the same <unk>
They shake <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> exams are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're at minimal cost, and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost of it, it appears on massive scale.
These are some incredible goals to <unk>
We can reduce the patient difficulties in the patients.
It would do not have to go to the clinic for the visit, routine.
We could very often get data goals.
We could make a massive <unk> of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're hitting the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or Parkinson's disease, can call low price and put recordings over a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've had six hours of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: And so we <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people -- you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max
<unk> You can see, some people may not be able to do it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the factors factors in pursuit of real markers for the disease.
TR: You have a precision <unk> at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to have done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile telephony as well, what we put the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of the 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were focusing on the darkness, in <unk> rooms and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the blood models still more <unk> the perfect skin is still more perfect -- we do the impossible, and we were interested in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that were going on in Japan.
Soon after that, an organization where I was voluntary -- where I was a voluntary -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay in the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishermen of fishermen located in <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave, <unk>
On the level of water by the level of water -- it reached more than 24 feet tall and over three kilometers on the inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
We have rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools removed the mud and leave the houses in order to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of fish and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We loved it, and we loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of people around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those photos represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean toilets <unk> huge bathrooms.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I had the honor and I had the honor that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years ago, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and to repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the <unk> of the girl, I had to do it with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got more pictures and they needed more <unk> and so I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk> <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to north of <unk>
And once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of a time that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depends on the <unk> of the photos.
She could get an hour. I could have a couple of weeks.
It could be a months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using a guide the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that are floating in the water -- which is saltwater, with <unk> with <unk> and even with the time of the time in time with the time step in time, I continue to <unk> that was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless I was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We have the guidance of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As a <unk> once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these photographs was lucky to talk to the photos.
And I had started to <unk> she was stopped to realize that I would find them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in one picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up his photos I shared some of your story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos in a fire station, between the rubble of the rubble in the rubble far from where they used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their kids little, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find her whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day he gave him his photographs his little son and she was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could be able to go back to look, something that I could remember from the past day that would have been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, <unk> hundreds of them were helped to clean up more than <unk> pictures -- the great <unk> -- the great majority came back to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us return to 90 families and hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more of <unk> a thousand in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take photographs all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved one.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would give us but the first thing that we would take to look for.
This is what the project was about restore little pieces of humanity, to return to someone that was a connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's not a huge difference in the life of the person who comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something bigger -- to give them something, using their talent for something that are not going to be thin blood models.
To finish up I'd like to read this email -- I sent him <unk> the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As I could, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the pictures.
One particular picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family, my grandmother, my mother, I and my <unk> <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all our few basic needs, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that's going through an apple in a exhibition just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a thousand <unk> but a trillion frames per second.
Let me introduce you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can make videos in slow motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can be able to see after the <unk> of the vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on it, and it would be <unk> in a second or so, in a number of <unk> to create a load of photons of just a millimeter shot.
And that package of photons, will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet is.
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread those photons into this <unk>
What is the view of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to take this research --   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, start <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it's going to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the insights on the top of the bottle, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
A Second week? One year.
It would be a very boring movie -- of a slow <unk>
And how about how about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of <unk>
But if you look more and more <unk> you realize that, as the light <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is bounces on its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at MIT today.
As a photographers, you know, if we take a photo to low exposure, it goes very little <unk>
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exposure short, so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You want to go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from down to the camera.
where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly enough, at times slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what dot corresponds to what point is distance.
When you project a laser projecting a <unk> you can see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we be able to look at <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that will be <unk> with what's going around the curve, the curve.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could be able to build <unk> able to see the inside of the body by having <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood that's quite hard, so actually this is a request to scientists so that you start thinking about <unk> as a new modality model to solve the problems of data in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, it became the science of art, an art of photographs of pictures.
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected are not just for scientific <unk> but we can see.
It will create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and colored <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are leaving us.
<unk> should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, and we have weird effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes has invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding pattern of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can be <unk> life, and gives you free freedom.
With a cell phone, you can put a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a <unk> and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and you would get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathered in search of a change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who would you have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your cell phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's very much. Almost everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> Commission filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider from all Europe, has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet vendor or his <unk>
And all Europe stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some people even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all of this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a lawsuit because I wanted this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it, I agree.
They took the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> of information.
When I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what did I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I go at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> <unk> means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom up and zoom back and go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one calls each other, and the other one to another, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would have never happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to my friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and that it's not in fashion.
When you go home, you get to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that make them to remember that you have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what's going on?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, that's why we were going through all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C, it's not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've got to be a disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> Christmas -- they're in the shopping center, driving in circles and <unk> and what do you see?
16 empty places for a disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am a Muslim <unk> woman, young, I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, they might be able to do it.
I'm from Park Park in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my illness had the same initial ones.
I also love walking from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk> puede" time.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three major sisters.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents were going to the school system and the <unk> of the school system that I also was, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note every single note of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would do it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> like the campaign.
People who I grew up had had trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger on the <unk>
And I told them that it had enough fat to live three months without eating, so let's take the dawn to sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay the physical therapy for that sent me to the dance school.
I learned dancing with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of the <unk> I was not going.
I was spending my summers in an area of war, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to <unk>
On summer holiday, I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back, so I was drinking milk on the back, <unk> me in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> the eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before we do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand out of <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in the head.
My parents would give this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like <unk> pet in the theater.
Everyone <unk>
I made all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
This is a piece of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "When I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it. I would end up.
Thanks to God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department crying in historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask me why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the magic scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the cooking stunts you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that was literally born and they gave it to an actor without a cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for a disabled papers.
When I graduated home, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was like an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the route of <unk> don't <unk> actors -- not necessarily white, <unk> with disabilities.
They just give perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, I took <unk> books from New York City to New Jersey, and I never will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell at the realization that he was going at high speed on the New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs in the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Film Festival in New York City year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then to remind the <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of stigma in disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by wire in the back with Keith <unk>
I came to me as if I went to a graduate dance, I was invited to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I signed up to the desk of the speaker to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
And I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I went back as a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people in the Internet are <unk>
The kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or a little girl or older girl.
All of a sudden, my disability in the Internet became an object of <unk>
I read clips online, like, "Why would you <unk>
"Is it <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk>
What does this disease have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors would say they don't want to do, but I'm here in front of you.
And yet, I have grown up with the media, I don't think it will be.
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world -- "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity organization to give to the Syrian refugee children, a very narrow part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I do this talk to your memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> pushes up to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
No for him there, goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there's no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year -- nothing.
One day he got about a man who offered him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to her family.
They show a young guy.
Finally, they go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That kid of that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he took out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in the London <unk> riots in London, who seek something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity of the opportunity for work, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from higher levels of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to violence, to the <unk> to be the story of renewable cities.
And in my city of birth, by 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, go to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, "Oh, I would never have gone?
And if I was forced to be forced to be in that same <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few youth leaders at a corporate price.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because I was a graduate student, <unk> college was the perfect white <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
She started <unk> <unk> local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and her dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this a story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit -- and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They were going to get young people to be the creators of the economic opportunity that are looking for as possible.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how it will be innovative and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years old, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from the abroad.
If you give somebody, "When was the last time you saw the <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer becomes, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, as he said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the homes, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire the young people, and in that room, the Mohamed presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So I inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to deal with the development and run out of their businesses.
They are going to give young people with the resources that they need, and they need the support that need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park in <unk> that's how called, when it's created, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young people are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks from <unk> which <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed of the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with the hearts of apple <unk> <unk> <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> <unk> <unk> our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, by about 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know it as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and I interviewed people in office and interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed more <unk>
So I started working like <unk> of trash.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I have <unk>
And operated the mechanical and the <unk> of the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you think, and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Justice <unk> the collection of waste is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass it around.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall on the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature in it.
She stopped coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the <unk> and the effective way every day, this starts to take advantage of their containers and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
So diseases that we had controlled for decades, and centuries they come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
And so I mean just the speed that we used to move in the <unk> time.
We usually don't get rid of it, and we have to get our coffee cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every single day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a gathering of waste on the street, grabbed my son, and I went down the stairs and he went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's go right.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate the gathering of waste and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times and we got good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account all the costs -- even the very real human cost of labor.
The Pacific waste, what we think when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable thought.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose work is cleaning up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
I would have a moment to tell you so much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are both located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis lines.
This is the kind of building that showed us like example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to take a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, he looks like it has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really led with the old market that is this structure in the air that is the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
That's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the website, which is located in a lot of a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this goes out with an <unk> <unk> which creates an outdoor space in the building that was <unk> by its own form, in the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that supports the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a concrete shell, in order to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled in the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center, and it wasn't what I <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center is going to be much more profitable than the commercial center is because in order to sell it more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity was cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, that we collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a teacher of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project, the biggest project I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
So during that analytics I put special attention on the <unk> a structure of a thousand years of ancient <unk> that was surrounded by a <unk> <unk> doors of <unk> <unk>
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets and then creating 12 initial blocks in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some points for a relationship with the idea of the doors of <unk> with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell cell, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So I would give you a scheme to make sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density in higher levels and a smaller density in the <unk>
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to the entire space of the construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and forth and <unk> and make activities such as a race of two miles per morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people change communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as an objective to connect the nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I was doing my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the middle of school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast of it was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
I took the ratings on my <unk> just a little bit, just a few these.
All the same.  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row of a row of that, just by being there, because I am."
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I never got <unk>
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason that I was bothered by that this little girl, so small, it was so good for <unk>
Do you introduce the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of global murder in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab where you study them in all their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no idea that if there was no <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> there would be no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> <unk> and <unk>
No Shakespeare.
I took the lists of reading from high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost you have all of them.
This year is a hundred years of his work -- "In the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> -- my God, all you might have. And then thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard this image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the properties that get reduced to the person to their wish, to their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel animals, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in the <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details that we could do to <unk> right?
The <unk> are doing all the amateur novelists and that is something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give it to each other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm cool thing that <unk> detects in his lover -- it adds up to his collection of instruments in her private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break on it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are they <unk>
<unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> they like the big <unk> and the cute little hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links very well.
When you look at it in his <unk> agony as soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then it understands those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are <unk> research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, for truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, to what they <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman to whom we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a range of much deeper feelings and vital vital than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> disclose ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way?
Is there any other excitement <unk> our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other excitement that teaches us to look at so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man, that he didn't laugh at what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion of no cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of your wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels really described very well how <unk> do you look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become the residents of the fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts of violent acts of acts or illegal.
<unk> lead us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from the one that was sent messages to itself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to get her back to the new girlfriend of her former former boyfriend, I have to say that when I was this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge even though you get? Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books who are trying to treat our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to do what you have to beat your being and <unk> from what ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, takes your rings, cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live at the time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
That is, we're good social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not secure, when they're just in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a little bit <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers you.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but it takes the help, and we will do it with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Six <unk> <unk> once you get in front of it, you can see in <unk> to all with his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> like a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're at the same side.
All of a sudden <unk> can be <unk> that idea of being <unk>
Could it even be so disappointing.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying <unk> Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> of Apollo 11, and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the gray surface -- it was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the Moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 businesses, universities and universities and government agencies.
They were killed, including the <unk> crew one.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which yellowfin after death of Armstrong last year, is the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why did you say, the cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Harvard University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do you turn it into our goal?
And they might also ask, why is it going to scale the <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice <unk> play.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
So we chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're hard. It's hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon came up in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the airplane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> was eliminated and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For the most part of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> ship, but in 1969, the Apollo <unk> crew flew for 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being got back to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than <unk> <unk> and the <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine that technology would like to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember the Apollo Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the <unk> <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission to <unk> but I was completely sure I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
And so that partly happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have <unk> us and grew up with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that they've created less ambitious companies that have been created from the years in which they are <unk> and Intel and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment led to the creation of ideas that are inspired by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even though the venture capitalists were at their highest point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with the benefit of technology as energy, which need a huge capital and development that is long-term in the long term. We've never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial value immediately.
No, the reasons we cannot solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we cannot fix big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption is about renewable energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that you can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties are according to what policies and international treaties will lead to a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that they looked together, are not to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have been taught that famines are the political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or the systems for the storage and food network, but there will be famines as there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are a lot of cancer types, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we can do it, but these four elements have been <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must want to solve the <unk> it must really be a problem with it, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it has to do with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition <unk> like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like the <unk> of the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> from our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and task that I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I kind of bow to think that there might be <unk> in some activities or institutions and there might be augmented in others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn into opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are going to be <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But is this evidence enough?
What the Swedish opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is the attitudes <unk> that people manifests themselves as certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
I'm probably going to be able to say, "Well, do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
In fact, in real life, we tend to increase the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel like a certain kind of official, officer or a person, it's going to be a uniform in all of those.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain teacher of elementary school that I know to give you the classroom, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave it all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to make a good judgment of inherent and somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I want to have more confidence in what it is about trust, but not what it isn't.
And then I am <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were sending their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, in them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what it means in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What this is about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw subjects and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason for trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible for us to not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would get their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we have tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we need that the system of accountability which is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we call the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
So we were doing all that, for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were to try to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we are reliable and if we are trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple action, the <unk> -- which doesn't make it properly.
Third, the task.
It goes to the task to rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's defining because they give us the other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all the people all the time, all the time.
But you also have to be <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks -- he says I can <unk> it without the other thing.
I wear it and get the money, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been getting more and more and more and more, at a point that today is one millimeter, the <unk> glass of a <unk> <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First I created this tool that gets deeper into the digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the transfers of your physical body on the ground.
Designers can get their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool break barriers.
But two hands still remain on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of hands?
In the Science Science division of Microsoft, and my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a transparent bombsight with the depth of the fingers to detect your fingers and your face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, getting inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there are the bottom of each floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
We have a lot of us to afford a lot of us to afford to get things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at the pixels in space, how we can do that are physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, that we created this only physical framework.
This magnet, <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control movement through a combination of levitation -- <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And when we programming the object digitally comes from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically -- physically and distance and the famous <unk> of Michael Jordan, can reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the motion of planets, physics, physics, and, in the text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information is not only going to show us something but start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was only a <unk> path to the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I want it to do or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio program.
But any adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends, but they were a kid, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life on a second class of life was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to find another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> it's about Chinese <unk>
And it's not a <unk> national <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "This is so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
So for example, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't you do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
To <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> Interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> path of <unk> Alan <unk> Rather than lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be feeling like <unk> ever.
Having a dream is really not something compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the dreams, from where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on the couch of my office and took my shoes off and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy just move the head while I <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I said, Alex, and so I would see she was right.
You start to work after, you go home after that, and they have children later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to grow up.
But soon after that, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to return to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get married the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in his development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of Ecuadorian <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and their loving life, but for careers, the families and the future <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent of the population, if you think nobody comes to age without going to happen before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> take your sleep off a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be about 35 years.
What this means is that eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and moments <unk> that they give her life to have gone to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> of more than 40, they don't <unk>
This audience is going to be well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they live with their future partner to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up the second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top of 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists would <unk> names of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Cohen was saying that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> to a <unk> in your head and say, "you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There is nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, I was really interesting like you or your kids and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, it's not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts going to sound like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better when I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts going to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit very extreme, but you don't know the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to 30 and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, to choose a partner, and to have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show, which is a lot harder and stressful to do everything from once to the <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
You realize that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> looked at themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and I talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said they would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living <unk> very difficult, your previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then she was getting up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she got his head on his legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book to <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I got <unk>
At that moment, it took me a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1920s.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or female, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> that identity of identity and <unk> capital capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, which by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma to explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that they get together with friends with the similar minds that are limited to who you know, what you know about, how they talk, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is going to go almost from outside of the nearest circle of it.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have any work.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs that we have never been able to do is then know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job of it.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last thing, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was really true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon brought her family, when you have a partner and in a form of his own family.
I told Emma the time to pick his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit in mind that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who would take them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a fellow in a cousin who worked in a museum museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, and he alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I would send me a letter to say, "Now the <unk> of emergency school are not enough.
<unk> story may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like planes coming out from the airport to Los Angeles, who come somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, on the 21st or the 25 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> who know.
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I have to have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get <unk> to get identity, using their weak ties.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very expensive job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics from seventh <unk> in New York City.
And as any teacher, we applied test tests.
I give you tasks.
When I went back, it was grades.
What struck me is that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance didn't have scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids did not tell them so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers, teachers working in the slums -- really hard, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results.
We partnered with private enterprises, and what of these marketers are going to keep their work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all of these very different contexts, it emerged a feature like a significant <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for years, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my partner, and then I waited for more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> <unk> even the safety of the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National National <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going to go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination often is not related to whether it's even related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not a degree that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be <unk> when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most favorite memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was obsessed with this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster way.
A Chinese scholar <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to understand.
The first 200 of them will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read your traffic signals, <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you can even be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were yelling at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> in the old West West.
I call a <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is a company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a forest, such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a board under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is pretty idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two together, it gets very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon goes together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build another 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn about a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is this in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where it goes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go off the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the <unk> of the Oz together.
So the <unk> film was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to wear a brilliant dress and take a magic wand, and take a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and I took a magic wand, and
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children into a kind of a complex defense show.
However, the <unk> of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took over 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy, and a young guy named <unk> to a girl dresses as a <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the <unk> of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the location of Oz gets done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> shoes to defeat the world's <unk> by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the unique thing from the <unk> of Oz is that the most wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Trek to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a kid.
For only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of supervision had been <unk>  So she was so slid in the room and he was struck as a mom left with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but I was like, <unk> it all.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke one was a military to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> of <unk>
How do you win Dorothy your movie?
<unk> <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to <unk> right? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much efficient capital of the films in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first election, I really expected to get them to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and I'm going to defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, the kids, they're not really your goal.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all of the time continues to come up with classic <unk> each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out there.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what critical is when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens to be <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It has not yet broken roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic of comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend of an assessment of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there's more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than you like it.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a sense of consensus of what a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the proof of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film is happening in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular films -- how many of them think they have actors.
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
Over the United States, one of five women says that it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think the music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is defeat the <unk> with violence, and then collect the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would do that, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character of Star Trek <unk> Do you know what you want.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk> these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
So I want you less stories in which I read to my <unk> <unk> and struggle only and more stories where it looked like their work is join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things that I was more like was looking for biscuits of sea at the shores of Maine, because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with time, I would get rid of <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use the infrared and we process it using false color suddenly the place looks like a brilliant pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the <unk> landscape of building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old city, old city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> I was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that are <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> about <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try and find the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> is <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks within the circle here, that we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of the sample of ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we seek layers of human occupation we look at human occupation we look at the human occupation of the human occupation we look at the human occupation we look at the human occupation of the human occupation we look at the human occupation we look at the human occupation we
Five feet down, under a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years to date back from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk>
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense <unk> <unk> that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a <unk> shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find <unk> here, but we would start to place it in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
So I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire -- probably <unk> <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is most of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to that, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we <unk> a group of obese <unk> in bicycles.
They're competing in a career <unk> and they are going in the direction to their entrance door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere -- wheels that go on to their side of the wheels that end up in places <unk> the threshold of the gate, <unk>
In the lobby, to the hall, or whatever there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
Can you feel your blue <unk> your tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you go to the <unk> point in the mouth.
They slept on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his center in the center -- singing <unk> -- One was <unk>
Now I get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> path and from the oven, come to you -- <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that is conducted in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist who had a journalist, and I suppose, that was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just just once.
They took the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
<unk> entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be a phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and that has one of the best <unk>
I said, "Well, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition says they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient old techniques invented by two years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that I used to be used to memorize their narratives -- and that academics <unk> were used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did you not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy who's a little <unk> and he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how far our memory is doing that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library in the Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, a lot of treaties on memory memory does something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have done our modern world, but it also has changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed a cognitive mind.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this competition as unique from memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there's a <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a research group of University College invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know, to get brains in some way, structural brains or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI scanner, you would take your brains while they were doing numbers, numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They were actually <unk> or they looked at a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> competitive is driving as a career race in where every year appears to someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory memory.
On his desk, front of it, there's 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's at a point of trying to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there's a great amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all techniques used at the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you do?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really does not mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have flour <unk>
They're good when they return home to work.
You probably had some <unk>
And when I first looked at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is over a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> his memory poem, and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the hall is <unk>
<unk> all of us.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies to be <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't be able to <unk> the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
I stood out there, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in your mind, I could see where he had been sitting next to me.
I took the family family in the hand where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What we're going to find at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions on the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory.
If you were to tell me that the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I bet that if you tell them to say who I was sitting on the horse swimming horse in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and image of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> be the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treated of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from the same way that I had done it <unk> if they'd been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy image of image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine coming up to your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then it goes into the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word of word, which is going to confuse you, a typical of a typical time.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got rid of it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> boring.
Seriously, is how to see a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was kind of fun.
I would never expect it to be <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it really is about doing is to make more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I was pretty pretty much with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and a pair of security covered with tape, leaving just two <unk> because the sunset is the worst enemy of a memory of memory.
I ended up coming back back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone numbers and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights on how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of a gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> actually.
They work because they make us <unk>
It would be a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not going to hang down there.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is our short <unk> existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human in front of us, who walks our side to our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even want to be able to process <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so we would have just a <unk> and New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the toilet that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there was all the time I was going to see the television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, all of me -- and every time I was <unk> and I would go back in a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> no longer and hated it.
I took that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Right, right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, nor about those <unk> emotional connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under your roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what <unk> you think of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it so based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that you know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this little bit <unk> columns, a red brick -- that you leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the forms of life today.
<unk> we tried and we got so much, we get away from the people.
All of the black, we get rid of you, you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to those <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we all feel like <unk> So we start to experience the pendulum back to go ahead and over again, and so we've done this in the last 300 years, and of course we are in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I had <unk> the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know like and <unk>
And we were going to <unk> <unk> and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The forms are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the commercial centers, we moved to slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
These erotic fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating some other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we started to swing the next one in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques -- we have a computer design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics in general, were completely on a building.
The New York Times journal <unk> this building of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew in a half and a half thousand when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how it is possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium country happened with other star.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all of architecture. The digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves as fast, as it.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design 2, eight, or 100 more buildings before knowing if that I designed four years ago was successful or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to be going back to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts swing increasingly fast, until you get to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and they actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
We can now make the symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge, something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before they finished the building, it was a part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like it, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a <unk> because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building built today, first <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no single answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and drawings and complicated, and one is not a <unk> audience that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we ultimately will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking little parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve to make sport, or to <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars in the community together around that cause, is no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no longer matters whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> buildings, and more like it.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way to the most prestigious spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we formed our children, and the family <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does it in that great way -- typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. And he asked me to think, when did I stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people search for the Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> she's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And what his mom says and what his friends, or colleagues say, you say, you don't know who you believe.
So it makes a video of her, he publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others that please leave a <unk> "I'm a nice, I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, that gets these answers into one of the most vulnerable life stages through it.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in most of them teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time speaking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his bedroom all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, that we're always connected is attached to our children to <unk> based on the number of wanting that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a life in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is going to be <unk> digitally.
What is most prominent in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> size <unk> <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who are <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to do with what young people.
But the kids are also not immune to this.
like the <unk> of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all of this?
Well, we probably want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other things start to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as <unk> to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They are involved in the classroom arguments because they don't want to call attention to their physical form.
One of five aren't attending classes at all at the time when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the sports season -- if you don't think you see you good, specifically if you don't think you're nice enough -- <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow who are not really concerned about it.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it gives up regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with their little self-esteem are doing less fruits and vegetables, they eat more diet not that can lead to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by people around the surrounding people and they're at higher risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetics, sexual relationships to early ages and no protection and damage <unk>
The search of the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or no higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a day interview on one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that try?
We have this potential of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first one is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of available programs to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it.
So, we need to make sure that the program that is following our children not only will have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas -- the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of these are more crucial points for anyone willing to provide an education in a body self-esteem that works.
A education is a difference, but to deal with this problem it requires each of us to take the reins in the issue, and let's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
It challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judging people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time that you would take a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to the order of the whole person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people out of really making the difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them out of the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never being seen by being people who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is in mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
Her <unk>
Could it be simply the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if it was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was <unk> for you not to have long legs, <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would say free to your potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> to us.
But let's get our children to the truth.
And we will argue that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for who they are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> from a year of age today, become a lot of people in real change agents in the morning.
So let's do it.
The fifth November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense <unk>
By <unk> initially was saying, but being a prisoner for other female charges in others, they started planning attacks to about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans to be <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be able to save them.
Later it would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being he an engineer playing with a <unk> mother, American school, among the two they made all the possible for me for a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
And so I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in the whole human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are going to be <unk> to their convictions that think that you have to use all the possible means for everyone to live as them.
A few months before arrest him and explained that in the last weekends he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends he and a few friends, they had been going to <unk> <unk> in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that didn't know our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot -- I gave you a little bit of orange light on the goal and, to surprise you, especially of me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle became the other and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
Of such a parent, this child.
All of all, the comment came to them a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they thought they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting up with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground underground of the World Trade Center causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the silent class, silent and <unk> age.
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have developed social skills, to say <unk> and grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I became opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like your race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way of thinking, was during presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was involved in the subject of youth violence, as I had been victim of youth -- almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done was Jewish age.
I took a number of days to go out the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all of the life was made to me to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job, in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, they all gay people were bad <unk>
So I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that many of them were the smartest and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the other and so it was not easy for me to treat people, exactly the way that I would have wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I was taught as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be, but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came to the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me honest <unk> about my <unk> and help me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure out in a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my mind to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has had enough <unk> <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much it negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope that somebody, one day, who is going to bring to the violence -- I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I was going to get me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved pain and their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism talking, the victims of a sense, like rejection acts of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you everyone.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there is a film that's projected in your minds.
This is an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has sound sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
Do you feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as time of your childhood who project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly having a <unk> <unk> in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie are you who experience everything in life.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie, you, you and you.
There is nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have a life experience.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just the robots that we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> science, is an objective of language.
<unk> for nature, is subjective stuff.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, we would have this vision.
<unk> psychology was studying behavior -- <unk> neuroscience was studying the brain -- but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists as Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flourishing of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness science in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that I introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of watching faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a 21st-century science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of neuroscience of neuroscience will respond to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain and what are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to be converted into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do you operate the <unk> how they work, how they are <unk> and how they are <unk> and they are resistant to living organisms, and they are all questions about the way that we work.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a phenomenon of <unk> how we speak, how we play <unk> how we play <unk> all of these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question why is all of the behavior that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a string of wonderful explanations -- great. We used to look like this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need a bit of radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning are crazy before they can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- the behaviors of the brain -- and it actually studies all that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many other people, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be <unk>
But I'm going in a different direction.
And in the time you've got it, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as core <unk> space, the space and the mass.
They have fundamental laws that <unk> the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explaining in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, it looks like fundamental, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> figured out that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- time, mass law, mass laws -- so he applied the basic laws of poverty, and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time mass, then by a matter of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not the object of science.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts the space, the time, the mass of physical processes.
Now, physicists are sometimes saying that we want laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> in mind, every system is aware, not only human beings -- the dogs, the mice, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling -- some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about that <unk>
This is partly from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's a fundamental thing, like space, time and <unk> is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us <unk> it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that make the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there are information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, as a human consciousness complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and I developed <unk> with indirect methods.
It has a math measure integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of information, a high awareness.
In a mouse -- there's a medium of information integration as significant as significant, as much important awareness.
But when it comes to the worms -- microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller but not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a <unk> level of zero.
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Now, physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the bottom of the below.
So this explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to solve our relationship with nature, and it can have a pretty serious ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think I think, well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical and moral terms, not so much the fact of consciousness, but their importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right now, they present very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, and at this moment we have a collective collective consciousness for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure about the very crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental idea, than the second is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path toward a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we're finally going to be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, an underwater profile.
I went to school, I was standing with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to be <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem evident.
She actually hasn't achieved anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the class 11, a guy raised his hand up and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people are chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't, and it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to be able to understand.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and you're probably waiting for you to give them it? Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we've lied to you that have lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is a <unk> A <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability that makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't do <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be that you've seen one of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn -- we would have to take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disability in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I have lost the number of the number of times that I've been dealing with strangers -- to express that they believe that I'm brave or an source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was excited about getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will lead to people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so that you can see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
It would have a few things.
But the things we took.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was telling me to the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of society that we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
The things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as you can do it, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to be <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration -- and you think, "Oh my God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
But I don't know that I'm fortunate to be lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> <unk> to collect the things that are over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to carry on the mobile phone battery on a chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a trajectory of stairs has never made it to become a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered <unk> of nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> by getting out of bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the true achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 grade school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what's a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to figure out.
I have to use words.
So I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running for the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> trying to do it with all of their self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I would have some videos to show you what it is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit of <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the field of football, from <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players -- and they have asked me on YouTube and asked me to see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how we bring it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, great.
No, no, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh my God! Oh, my God!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before and make a <unk> What is the experience of a fan experience.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball off the bottom of the network? or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to the reality <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick view of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore was placed to her <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, more quickly.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see her next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that comes in -- you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
It or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they are <unk> and they hate <unk>
If you lose games to you just like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game to play the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This would lead to the good guys.
So, your team of computing will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It will be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in <unk>
Imagine it's the field <unk>
It was <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- <unk> that a defense behind you is going to <unk> not <unk> but the <unk> system will <unk>
It <unk> the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land, but the receptor sees the display of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have continued to move it from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask them is, we want this to be the only use of reality reality.
We're going to use it as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage the empathy between human beings to show someone how it is, literally, be in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad the actions of the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live being <unk>
How much is it worth of a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes over.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, as well.
Thank you.
Recently I was introduced after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years has been <unk> the southern end of the county of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to the global <unk> of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, chief engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much the proof of <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has <unk> as such, so that each of it from him released from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that goes under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free to five to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles an hour.
<unk> impact will break down the bones, some of which will make vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that don't, normally <unk> in the <unk> water and then <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of this suicide method will realize <unk> death to the one that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the more dark, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young woman was talking to a officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had this day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have a formal training.
They were going to be able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, medical officials today and psychologists train new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him from Julius 22 of the year to getting a call from a single suicide bomber sitting on the mud near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason talking with a officer of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here two times before from New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came up with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
It stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had made it.
<unk> damage to a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it out to be <unk>
What would you find?
So what does it say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you need to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They went to the person in front of them can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to despair, despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permit and blessing to read.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience there.
I'm thinking that I should go back to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and they were <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and reported that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness I had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thanks very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been prior to suffer a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a single suicide bomber on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I took my motorbikes on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing in the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next and half of the following time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to tell you that day back to that lane and give life another opportunity.
When I Kevin went back, you know?
"This is a new <unk> a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that he made it to <unk> and gave him the hope and other <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I was left to talk and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the 11 o'clock events, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- <unk> but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> <unk> When I visited General <unk> at San Francisco that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, the opportunity to meet you.
This is what suicide.
For most of the people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Usually this is actually achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Out of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And for that time, I was given my hand at three times.
I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few of you who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second that you leave on the side, the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be able to work on.
suicide can prevent.
There's help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but inside your inside, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you care about that?
I have to be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth with my inner self.
So by complicated reasons, what I'm going to talk to you later, when I look at this photo, I'm thinking, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm starting early.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the constraints of the skin of the skin or the belief that we are.
They're people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this t-shirt on his head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always going to take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that it's actually a more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never loved to share my story, not because it thought to be a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have Mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up with me, and I remember that moment as a little bit of me: This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still like, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a Google beauty competition.
That night she said, "Why don't you have been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was responsible for the expenses of <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the <unk> and he won in <unk> <unk> and was a third woman between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they were <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. My mom.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I had two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated sophisticated surgeries of secure.
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before we changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document, it means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was born, he lived his truth, but he was able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November 20 of November we do a global <unk> Day of <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of the injustice.
These are nowhere, P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that I have no more <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So thank you for all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were calling me and a few times, when I was called and told her parents couldn't accept it, I took my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table and what I try to do is to put a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very good, <unk> Thank you.
In many tribal societies, and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for his daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality and violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when I was born a girl, her birth is not <unk>
It is not welcoming and his father, and his mother.
The neighborhood comes out, gives you their <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of a <unk> for a child.
When it comes to the first girl, the first daughter, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when you get to her third daughter, you feel guilty like a criminal.
Not only mother suffering, but the daughter, <unk> daughter, <unk> when it grows, it suffers from as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school admits of their brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years, you have to go out of her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes a so-called honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if you would take the code of that <unk> of that honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this code of honor, it doesn't only affect the lives of a <unk> also affects the life of male male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in behalf of honor.
And there's one more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
Is the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother decisions even if he doesn't like.
If you put it up with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, you have to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If you have a young <unk> you have to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his kids.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like our newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was going, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came up when she was four and a half years old, I read her in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developing countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the child's life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and his name.
One went to school means that it's in the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when you get the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I went to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
I was encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the way.
I used education to <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation in all of political and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers who were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> he got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, and he wrote a day for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
<unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and the ninth of October 2012, was fired to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would love him to the ear of my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of peace, and by the cause of the education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get paid.
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words have a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and I had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist at the most difficult times, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children of children and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when you don't just go his task.
They fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are there especially in my <unk> which has made so audacious to <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or I was out of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain surgery.
They're still as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen chemical powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything -- die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mixtures of chemicals, and trying to get it to stay alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to do it to try to get the doses of <unk> because it really doesn't have a clear map that tells you to <unk>
I started to test different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose were dramatically going to be my sense of who I was, my sense of who I was, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemical doses for a man in Harlem, and I was blown away by seeing how I would get my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types of species, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to do -- I mean, I've been better from the men.
What it was trying to do is <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
<unk> to think about as always in images, and that became my point for key reference -- how do I get those mental imagery that I use to create <unk> my ideas -- if you get <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds of the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So, after several years, I can find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to carry very quickly these mental imagery of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities for this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that are done by two groups that are done by two groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image fMRI -- to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks an image.
The middle of the medium shows the brain scan of that same individual as you were to see that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine to see that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share another one another experiment. This is from the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were taking their brains to create a large array of brain reactions to the video sequences in the video sequences.
And then they showed them a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as a new <unk>
And the computer using only the brain information in the scan of the scanning <unk> to show what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're well close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, you think of the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning brain systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and you get rid of electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of them are proposing new projection techniques for images, even me, <unk> with the latest result of MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvement on resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- let's make better magnets happen.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to do really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio rate in the MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field -- instead of <unk> magnetic patterns, the <unk> <unk> at the radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns -- we can actually increase <unk> the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split up the layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the <unk> <unk> fluid but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity is a dream.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our design skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give up this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just from <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet might be telling you some person for the first time you love, or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done in life.
So all I think is a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- I didn't know my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And it's going to be <unk> that by the <unk> of my <unk> and so I had <unk> my head I would usually ask you a little bit of a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would be a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a little bit of <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and they go through it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready to get into the women's issues on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues,"
And so I took a breath in and I went down to my back and my back and my back little girl in four years with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And then I took a breath back again, and I got rid of it close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is kind of tricky.
I have the short hair like a boy, and you see clothes, and you know, I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a little <unk>
Now, I'm more from the kind of girl in a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- "Oh, <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the hard conversation to everybody ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why I go out of my closet was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to somebody who has declared on banking in banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder to say to your five year-old son that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We have to stop classifying what is difficult to deal with what hard to other people to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse and <unk> shoes and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any four years to go into coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay grenade <unk> and the move just a muscle is the closest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends with the I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have been followed for so long, but if you don't shoot that <unk> you kill you.
And one of my most memorable translation launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of those guests knew that I was gay, and when I was doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known for me years old.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the gay story of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program. Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you can do.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have to have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what is going to get out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl at the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others have to know we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, you know.
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of them may be wounded out sure, and they have done, but they never relate to what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you're going to find in a dark <unk> <unk> <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very yourself, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen by an example of the intelligence, an example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical thing to the pioneers of computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would give a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a space race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or the Earth of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredibly amazing telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that explained how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that are going to take the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states, which will be <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I said, <unk> for several years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> <unk> which acts with the end of maximizing the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yeah, to an impending impending <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having on account this equation, is natural question: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to conditions more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence has a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes straight from it.
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize production of entropy in any system where they find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could be able to spend multiple animal testing, play games of human intelligence, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without being able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, the same as some other animals can cooperate throwing away from extreme opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> your potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly getting and keeps the very good net grid.
This same <unk> capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> by organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend to the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we are going to spontaneously spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation of actions, successfully increasing assets under their management costs.
This risk management ability will have huge applications in finance, in secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all flows from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term -- the <unk> labor, there was always the concept that if we were smart machines, there would be an <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all opposite, that the urge to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than intelligence, general intelligence can actually come out of control, instead of being upside down.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to get out of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to happen to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the world's <unk> and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded much our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to that the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint intensity intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light coming up with us.
The data picked up the Kepler show the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their star star.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their name.
It gives you clues about if these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since now has been disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I am not a weather scientist and no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to the Earth, and I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the first discovered and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world, shown this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and part of it that we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now offered not just short flights flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images, remind us to deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going through <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places of the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen, by our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag up with a big and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief in some that Mars will expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly true, the Earth.
For a lot that I like the exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to help humanity is as to imagine that the captain of Titanic comes to us that the party of truth will be later on the <unk> <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and land is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment that was <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist. Enrico Fermi asked myself, have to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we're going to develop this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization we can save ourselves out of ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to reflect on the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the most easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty closed.
I thought to call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend to go home because I had a flight early to Europe -- next and <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that they didn't more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I'd come out very stopped.
I'm a prisoner of profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that goes up the heart rate -- <unk> the adrenaline levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in your place, that <unk> the bad things happen.
Or at least if you happen to be wrong things, that you will make the chance that it's a total radiation.
So I started to think about that, but even a month later, my thoughts didn't know.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize and a little embarrassed to him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> like explaining <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might get out wrong, then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not that evident.
I'm going to start with obvious things.
And in the house, you get a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of important things, where the fish are right, where you are the fish that appear the <unk> trees where the tribes are and friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the <unk> in London.
This is the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose your car, <unk> <unk>
So at home, you know, a place for the keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular discussion.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with it all the things that are always going to be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take with your cell phone -- a photo of your credit card cards for mail to know themselves in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is recognizing that under stress we won't be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on it.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved decision to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from the fact that they would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the outcome of the lab and your cholesterol is a little bit of <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, attack the heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce a <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even more likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most of the doctors don't want to talk about, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or vote at any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's someone else's fault is scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs just works only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you can help someone person?
300.
This is according to the research of cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explore numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to <unk> my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> from the effects of <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress not think clearly.
So think of how we can do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of <unk> by the drug that will help you help you.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say you have to have this conversation with your physician.
healthcare ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the <unk> but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that is more done in the largest men of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent effects just <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue to you that will be <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life on pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that point is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it's not very quickly. They could be lunch lunch -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking -- like Danny <unk> and their colleagues have shown.
So we have to figure out the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at the time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help you minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things going on in the first place.
<unk> at the snow night in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the door door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> where you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never going to be a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of signs, <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came during the decade of 1800, and over the time of time, it mixed up with local signs, and it developed the language we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, and it was like I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do I understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my little <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"You don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise as a eat of the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure it doesn't <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
All of this call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person doing it.
I'm super <unk> from the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do this with my thumb that's not natural.
That's why I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I was working like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no eye art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my artwork.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel that <unk> or experience or experience visually, or even as a idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was shocked with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like not to have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary way of value in a way like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to go with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express it fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor of the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the movement of the body -- the speed, the shape of the hand and like that, while you touch the piano, English is a linear language -- as if it's <unk> only one key at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way that to express a clear concept or idea of <unk>
If I just could change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters, they can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
Oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and fold it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you catch up.
This is the day."
If you put it up, and you take the right speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said of <unk> the <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> the <unk>
I feel like the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express change in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand -- two <unk> is two hands, the present one gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of your hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everyone in high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like his chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third one. Please give you again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all happen on the head and the chest but they carry very different meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> We don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I would like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble bubble -- I have to say, because adults would lie to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning up the other people.
And the country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk around the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it is also very risky to use those huge results.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I will say, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every single child and try to figure out something that we hope it works.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids will get a lot of with the robots.
And then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And it turned lights and web cameras to go ahead and fold it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor and the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a different estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
So I took this step back on a site to go on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would give him even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they get to try to get it right away.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this one.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the oil is brown and the oil is also brown color and when all the <unk> is very difficult to see what is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote way to other children.
I was compelled to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, and I might start to address a more difficult problem, and I'm also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started a giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than <unk> people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant to Fukushima, a nuclear central center near the water.
And today, according to the reports of the 300 million tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of the moment, is pretty sure, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the crash and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the children.
Of course I didn't have the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night I went on to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was <unk> <unk>
But based on this organized an civil expedition the closest to the central nuclear central to date.
We zoom up to 1.5 miles of the nuclear control, and with the fishermen of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking tracking of sediment as we invented and build.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been getting more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to the largest and environmental impact.
It's in the heart of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically can be built almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So traditional scientists, creators, <unk> we must make the next generation for the environment and the people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two <unk> in radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one thread of <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic thing.
One <unk> on the environment, the other once thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we carry all the information that was required for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has mastered by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
The lines of <unk> have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores here.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily as <unk> the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that changes gradually its functionality through the variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- twice the personality of every designer and an architect to work in the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right hemisphere and the right hemisphere is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in their most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and getting to the growth.
Are you probably wondering why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird, weird moment, where four disciplines that give designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, scale, like this robotic arm with a range of 24 meters in diameter with a base of a chance that someday not too far to print <unk> buildings, and the nanoscale figures made of genetically altered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is the only size of the only light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> they're going <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with collaborator with 3D printing, we print this layer and 3D <unk> in the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This cap combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, comfortable and also <unk> sound.
The Carter professor -- my collaborator, collaborator, went back to the nature of <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this <unk> surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to other material or other <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and got to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if the objects were made of a single pieces.
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material that we would find out the kind of material of the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons to produce every year by organisms like shrimp, or political, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call this legal <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
<unk> concentrations -- chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a half material from a long material of long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, you let them dry to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the process of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> that came for the first time on the planet over a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture very rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if it extends even more, to windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've been transformed by a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> put in the sea, and they would raise the life and put it in the ground, they will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new <unk> in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and in the <unk> <unk>
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine in the human staff.
It turns the light into sugar, the other burning sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the <unk> tract that will help the <unk> of these bacteria and that they get their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body -- we will make the properties of material according to the functionality of the material.
If we wanted more <unk> we would take more transparent channels.
This <unk> digestive system when it stretches from one end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our intestine very thin.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> he said, "We are <unk> middle-class creatures just <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that make the matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> tissue tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
So for it, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer does that make material material.
You also know that nature doesn't make it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture that is a home within which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, <unk> in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
However, when we put silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they were <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different parts -- and we've discovered that shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> would be transmitted directly through the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew the silk silk worms to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, <unk> the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
The biological silk is about <unk> <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give up the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from inspired by inspired by an inspired nature of design, which demands for us, for the first time, that we have charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they first asked them for the first time.
They can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I loved English, the <unk> and the art and he went on websites and he turned the guitar into a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And usually I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to go on.
But then I was asked by something else, something totally different, and I was excited about it, and I'm going to get <unk> and I have found <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me for not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or to be awake or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where learned the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> learned about culture.
We asked ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were doing at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is given us over and again as we grow in various different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask them to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of before what it takes to get off the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspire children to dream with what they might be, not inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the other thing, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though you might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> professor and creative design.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to be involved during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that he wants to do?
There's no place to someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
Could it help you if you divide into three parts: potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that will be <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, and we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as the limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared in the basis of data, and travel, mathematics and design, to start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewels <unk>
To <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for your <unk> blending of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens in intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all its background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is a quick learning.
When we blow them up, we are interested in it.
We look at all that we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because they have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> and full-time writer and <unk>
As a young pianist farmers, an incredible ability to develop muscle <unk>
Now, she's the most quickly known <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales of sales when they started their own, and this ability helps to write a compelling amount for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to be able to do what you're going to do, even if you end the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a whole different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. It is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of the other other days, a newspaper designer, sometimes consultant to Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, it turns James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> Company Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that might be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart <unk>
<unk> the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you.
In fact, some of the best teams made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The expert can dive deep deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we can do with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a great part of them will be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said that, if there's one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then, let's go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world will <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I was <unk> to a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising.
If you were to have been living today, we couldn't give it more help than he was <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that now we call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> lots of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs.
But a little bit has been made on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the chance that your years will pass on, Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or want Alzheimer's disease.
It's already in America, cardiovascular care, costing 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their cost costs -- an increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest social and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in death despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everyone else has to be, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of us -- all of the scientists, most scientists, lead Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy brain compared to the disease of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage to this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the brain damage to the brain reduces significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these dots end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the dots are going into the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
He would take a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the <unk> bomb.
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part of the wires have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, physical, physical, engineers, and mathematicians.
And together, we have managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that quickly quickly quickly quickly block this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when they test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see it moves normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that they stick into each other inside of them, as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to warn you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we will, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases and their families and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry on scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the New York column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it at the same summer of the summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get a lot more personal questions, and then you both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would be?
Number one: When was the last time you had another person?
And <unk>
<unk> are getting more personal and more personal.
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me to tell your partner what you like about him or it, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me about the attention that two of participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Catholic column for a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are likely to be wondering -- they still keep up with.
And the reason I think is asking this is because they've asked me this question again and again over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand of the seen.
And that came up with a very new burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I gave it, I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night at night, and then Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday has been called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, kind of prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing with openness to <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or I had a <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they were asking first the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and <unk> and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed by radio and <unk>
But even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable wondering about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> that included the experiences of the readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and we would take the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of the <unk> process, a range of <unk> a range of <unk> a range of <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked out, they wanted to know if it really happens, or if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people made the wrong question.
How do you want to know if you go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the purpose of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Rather than that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic sounds right?
But the study did work.
Participants felt closer to do the participants in the most close studies as we do -- several later studies also used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it among people of the opposite <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately it never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you were <unk> from the person who would do it.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better better after proving the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for the moment of love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation through a lot.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was not supposed to have all my adulthood, and he was my first real love -- and he had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I took to science.
And I did all I was able to find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I was just thinking about the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel as bad as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful from one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I am.
But I can also see the most clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much what you can demand for me.
What I'm looking for for love is a <unk> not only to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> lying on the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to be able to mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very strong story, because they fall in love with us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
So the story of the story that says, still follows together?
And your content with an answer to know or No.
So more than a question is, let's try to do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who you deserve your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your mate?
I don't know necessarily answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known thing and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
They fall in love with fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit when I read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was nothing that was supposed to be that choice.
I didn't look at how many times we would have both of them to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded by 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone so generous, and they have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe true.
And what we're going to do, and what I might maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really have.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose somebody, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> <unk> and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
One of New York City makes a time --  -- one that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you would take a dollar ticket a dollar, a pen and a fork in the Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species, ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment because I was in <unk> <unk> like to go out of tour and make <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took out all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added the more resin on the canvas, and thinking he could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: in some way it seemed like it grows on size as if it was that they were going to get the text with a <unk>
So I <unk> I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add some electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all that I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw like it does about a <unk> on the scene of crime.
And I took the objects out and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form of human beings with the <unk> of natural beings with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed at every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to drawing on a window, then in another window, and then another window, and I had all these windows together that come together with a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big that I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know it.
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation to this <unk> mesh of <unk> where it was <unk>
This is where the creatures of animals are heading for <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while in the other hand, they get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
So that's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak and spitting clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail goes on fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why this country is.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> made from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were out of baseball cards.
It leads me to the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries.
But every one acts as a kind of a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. She's carrying years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds with a human <unk> inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can <unk> the entrance on.
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it does, a kind of thing that was <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box, there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
We get the box out of the box and all of the people in relation to each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that is living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very much made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have the effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is effect on the body.
<unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients.
When you take <unk> drugs, these are being able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the standard of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> because in the time that it takes to get to the current current -- and even worse for the time that it takes to get on their destination, which is where it's more important, that is where it's more important: <unk> HIV.
These are regions of the body as the <unk> <unk> the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't be easily on the stream of blood in the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life for life <unk>
One day, I felt and I thought, "Do you get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery from diabetes, they can be used for anything else -- including the drug transport of drugs.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes that open up and shut up almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to get drugs.
The best people are asked, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is moving to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you have successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups -- not <unk> military organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of violent participation.
I do a field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors and non-governmental actors.
For instance, of the <unk> arrangements of 1975 in 1975, and 2011, <unk> were signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody looks at what they do when they didn't go to it.
The armed struggle and the policies are not armed and <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party and a military services and a military services.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking ...
<unk> a complex consumer machinery of radio stations, radio stations, online Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund without <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn through war, or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for providing safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price strong <unk>
But in general, providing social services means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap for government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps from government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, involved in violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the sophisticated organizations are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It turns out part of a territory, running all the <unk> they collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and without state and hybrids and the more weak people are states, like in the Middle East, more <unk> and fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to be able to invest more in tools not military tools.
<unk> that vacuum vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentive to offer to encourage violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, military power can win some <unk> but we don't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that safety vacuum to fill that vacuum vacuum of the government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the openly <unk> would be unfair to <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I was struck by a feminist feminist guy.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and who are <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> who might be a feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and bad word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I went growing, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They were doing the same paycheck for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to figure out our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, gender of gender, religion and our own social condition and much more.
We have to have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, listen to rap music <unk> all volume.
Even though the letter degrades women and I was honest, the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely overwhelmed by my music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the collection of trash, and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
They get away from fashion magazines and of nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that they do.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it causes women to be economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the business and gay workers and <unk> for white, white, <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism am a very bad feminist now.
It also happens by this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put psychologists <unk> in a <unk>
So we hope that we were going to play perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and civil leaders are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> fear of what that tag means for fear of being able to be able to be able to fulfill a little bit realistic.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this star of poop embrace the feminism and make women and young men who have to be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics had endless debates -- if they were -- or it was not a feminist or either.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection is because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot.
We're going to go much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to the day, will go to action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we manage the change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does this music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions have been discussed that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to us and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> for three and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and too brave. I want you to grow in a world.
They're going to spread out of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will become a lot easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio radio when we hear songs they treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women as well as <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, to participate in his project, or work with you, until I don't include enough number of women, so much to participate in order to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage in this kind of projects, we can also be able to engage them to even more and more like us to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to decision making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to people in the power of directors and cinema and film and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to happen, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of it -- because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know the kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I'm not going to believe I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was obsessed with a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, it also discovered that if it was a little brave -- another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to accomplish anything.
And in the other, I have the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good feminist, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that all of us can be a little bit courageous, when it needs such <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, they had <unk> to be asked to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be a terrible child for a child with a immune immune system is one of the most compelling diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this from more than half -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that there was the concern about autism and the vaccines that are going to be <unk> and represented by being <unk> fraud by the British Medical Council.
It doesn't believe most of the intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of fathers around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very weird disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it would create all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued stable just three or four children for every 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> fundraising organizations, like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease disease, what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like diagnostic <unk> <unk> and "A better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young woman who seeks to be in the face of his two-year-old son with visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> in the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is, and how autism discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 patients who seemed to be <unk> private, private, private worlds to people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving your hands before their faces, but they were <unk> of panic by <unk> like when you don't put their favorite toy on your favorite place in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the topic, declared that I'd seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome as far as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 kids sent by the other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of newborn children caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have kept it carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they put in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, which researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of moms <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John were people warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a child and no special education, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend at the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in the world.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
So again, these kids didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of your data.
How did nobody ever realized these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then they were <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but he avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was no even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a prison school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability of life that required <unk> and spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of dealing with kids in their clinic as patients, <unk> I called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of the methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuous that took a surprising variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith figured out that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk>
These changes didn't fall in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult adult first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, and fathers around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact waiting for the people with autism and their families to finally get the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> a simple, powerful simple, <unk> history, such bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, the autistic people, have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are going to solve by the new advances.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC will not work with Windows -- it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it's a deficit deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck and <unk> the <unk>
As we move towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to tackle the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste your brain.
Thank you.
